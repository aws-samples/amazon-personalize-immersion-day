Major banks and tech companies are experimenting with it. Ethereum is a new blockchainbased platform that allows developers to build decentralized applications on top of it. It was created in 2014 by Vitalik Buterin and has gained a lot of interest from major banks and companies. Unlike Bitcoin, which was created anonymously, Ethereum was created in a transparent way by Buterin when he was 21 years old. The platform allows developers to program smart contracts that execute automatically when conditions are met. This enables new kinds of blockchainbased applications. Ethereum raised $18 million in a presale of its native cryptocurrency ether in 2014. This helped fund the nonprofit Ethereum Foundation which supports the platform's development. There is now a dedicated network of thousands of computers worldwide that support the platform. The platform is still new and faces technical and legal challenges. But major banks like JPMorgan have experimented with private Ethereum blockchains. Microsoft and IBM are also working on Ethereum projects. The value of ether has risen rapidly, making the total value of ether outstanding over $1 billion recently. While Bitcoin is still the biggest cryptocurrency, experts say Ethereum is now number two and has a good chance of surviving longterm if real applications are built on it. It delivers on some of Bitcoin's failed promise around enabling new types of markets and contracts."

The article discusses decentralized conglomerates (DCs), which are the next evolution in conglomerate business models. DCs allow different organizations and communities to collaborate on a universal platform while still maintaining their individual brand identities. Unlike traditional conglomerates like Berkshire Hathaway where subsidiaries must follow the mission of the parent company, DCs allow their constituent organizations to operate independently. DCs are also more efficient at managing production and distribution than traditional conglomerates. The OpenLedger DC allows organizations to join forces with their communities on a universal platform that enables crosspromotion and profitsharing without forcing it. Anyone can create assets or tokens to represent their organization or commodity on the platform. Not all tokens carry equal risk. Bitcoin differs from DCs in that it has no organizational associations or special interests. This makes Bitcoin apolitical but also means it lacks an ecosystem to address issues like scaling. In contrast, DCs have vested organizations to provide stability and a unified approach. The article discusses partnerships between OBITS, BitTeaser, and OpenLedger where profits are shared via smart contracts. Writers and bloggers earned around 11 BTC ($4500) in the last distribution. Users can cash out DC rewards directly to fiat through OpenLedger's exchange integration."

The drop in sales and worsening financial situation of retailers have forced shopping malls to renegotiate some of the obligations of shopkeepers regarding outlet occupancy costs. This scenario has intensified, with onetime discounts and payment installments aimed at avoiding default and increasing vacancy rates. Shopping centers are freezing expiration of installment payments of \\\"gloves\\\", fees charged to new renters to guarantee the \\\"right\\\" to use a certain location in a mall. These amounts, which vary by demand, are usually paid in 1224 month installments, but now shopkeepers have obtained a \\\"temporary pardon\\\", spending time without paying and getting more months to pay. Malls are trying to prevent important stores from closing amid rising costs and poor sales, but the renegotiation also risks an overflow of defaults.

Sustainability requires better treatment of workers. The \\\"Uber for X\\\" model has failed to translate to many other industries beyond ridesharing. Companies like SpoonRocket, Luxe, and TaskRabbit initially got a lot of hype and venture capital funding, vowing to revolutionize their industries with an ondemand model. However, many have struggled to retain customers and have been forced to raise prices, degrade service, change business models, or shut down entirely. A key problem is that the low wages paid to ondemand workers have resulted in poor service and high turnover. The model relies on abundant cheap labor willing to work as 1099 contractors with unsteady income. But many workers were unhappy with the low pay, lack of steady hours, need to hustle between gigs, and oncall nature of the work. Consequently, service quality suffered and customer retention was low. The fundamentals of this model only worked with significant investor subsidies, which are now drying up. As VC funding recedes, companies are finding their low price points unsustainable without that \\\"VC welfare.\\\" This has forced many to pivot to more narrow services and traditional business models. Uber itself, despite its scale, essentially operates like a temp agency for drivers. Many sharing economy experts argue these companies are not fundamentally different than old labor brokers and temp agencies. While they leverage technology, the work relationships they've fostered remain poor, with minimal loyalty between workers and platforms. Their continued evolution will depend on developing quality jobs that engender a sense of commitment in workers. The model has proven effective at matching supply and demand for gig work, but truly thriving will require better treatment of workers."

Industrial adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT), dubbed Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), is increasing. However, nearterm IIoT adoption remains limited to achieving operational efficiency, as most companies cannot yet leverage IIoT for predictive capabilities to create new business opportunities. This article discusses the probable future of IIoT adoption and the need for businesses to develop IIoT investment strategies. During Digital India Week, Prime Minister Modi announced a Centre of Excellence for IoT. This will benefit India's industrial sectors like manufacturing, energy, agriculture, and transportation, which together account for close to half of India's GDP. Independent estimates place global IoT spending at $500 billion by 2020, potentially reaching $15 trillion of global GDP by 2030. India's share is estimated at 56% through 2020. While consumer IoT adoption will increase gradually, industrial companies are already embracing IIoT. For example, the number of shipped sensors grew over 5x from 2012 to 2014. IIoT offers productivity gains up to 30%, like through predictive maintenance to reduce breakdowns by 70%, maintenance costs by 30%, and repair costs by 12%. However, IIoT also enables breakthrough innovation and growth. Combining big data analytics with IIoT can create new opportunities, like payperuse car rental competing with taxis. But most companies struggle to optimize operations from data. Initial IIoT investments focus on uptime, but future priorities are profitability, competitive advantage, and environmental improvements. IIoT adoption will likely follow four phases: 1) operational efficiency, 2) new business models, 3) disruptive outcome economy, and 4) integrated humanmachine workforce. The last two phases will cause structural changes in 3+ years. But challenges remain, so companies must create more customer value now through IIoT."

Algorithms like Gaussian processes provide full probability distributions. Bayesian methods allow us to update our beliefs about probabilities as we obtain more data. We start with a prior belief, observe data, and use Bayes' rule to obtain a posterior belief. The likelihood indicates how probable the data is given our model parameters. The posterior tells us the probability of the parameters given the data. There are two main approaches to Bayesian methods. Statistical modeling is used when data is scarce. You carefully construct each part of the model. Probabilistic machine learning throws data at more automatic algorithms like LDA. Algorithms like Gaussian processes and Stan provide full probability distributions, allowing estimates of uncertainty. Variational inference trades some accuracy for speed.

This allows Facebook to get feedback on changes with millions of users before rolling changes out to everyone. The framework was critical for developing the new tabbased navigation, as Facebook tested dozens of navigation options before settling on the tab bar. While HTML5 allowed rapid testing and iteration, it resulted in poor app performance. The new framework restores rapid testing capabilities within the highperformance native app."

Tab bars keep navigation visible and are recommended instead. The hamburger menu or sidebar menu is a common UI pattern in mobile apps that hides navigation links behind a button, usually with three horizontal lines representing a hamburger. However, research suggests this pattern has significant usability problems: Lower discoverability Important navigation options are hidden from view, \\\"out of sight, out of mind.\\\" Users have to know the menu button is actionable. Less efficient Even if aware of the menu, it adds friction to reach navigation options instead of having them visible. Clashes with platform conventions On iOS, it conflicts with the standard back navigation button. Not glanceable Harder to show info or notifications about navigation options when they're hidden. Instead, the tab bar is recommended as it keeps navigation visible, accessible, doesn't conflict with gestures, and shows state/notifications. Sidebar menus may be OK in rare cases like apps without navigation hierarchies. Generally, the solution is to review information architecture and simplify rather than hide navigation. Other options are scrollable toolbars or putting navigation in the header. The goal is to avoid hidden navigation, allow direct access, and give feedback on related icons."

This builds empathy and accelerates failing fast and iteration. Amir Shevat, Director of Developer Relations at Slack, believes there are ways to avoid building bad products in the first place. In his Lean Startup Conference session, he explained how rethinking product experiences as conversations can provide faster feedback. He demonstrated by awkwardly asking an audience member for personal information without context. This mimics apps that immediately request info without engaging users. Amir then presented two signup flows for a photo app one shorter and one longer with more engagement. The audience guessed the shorter one was better, but turns out the longer one drove better retention. This shows value should be conveyed upfront in an organic exchange. Observing inapp conversations, not just feedback, validates products. Amir gave an example with his meditation app, where he shortened sessions based on inapp behavior vs feedback. Rapid inapp validation through conversation helps build better products faster. Failing fast and iteration are still key, but empathy and conversation accelerate this."

The energy usage of Bitcoin mining has received a lot of attention over the years. As demand for mining power increases to support the Bitcoin network, more mining devices are being deployed by manufacturers, all of which consume significant electricity. A recent article shows that the growing electricity consumption of Bitcoin miners could surpass the total electricity usage of Denmark by 2020. Bitcoin mining is the process of confirming transactions on the network by mining new blocks. As the ecosystem has grown exponentially in recent years, mining has become more computationally intensive, requiring more powerful but energyhungry hardware. Mining at home is now infeasible in most countries due to electricity costs. According to calculations by one researcher, Bitcoin mining's electricity consumption will equal Denmark's total usage by 2020. While mining hardware is becoming more efficient, more devices are being deployed, increasing overall consumption. Two scenarios are proposed: 1) Efficiency improvements outpace deployment, slowing consumption growth. 2) Stagnating efficiency and increasing deployment lead to consumption rivaling Denmark's. While mining's energy usage is concerning, Bitcoin enables a global financial system accessible to anyone. There are costs to financial freedom.

The extension manages connections to Linux machines, copies sources for remote building, launches applications with the debugger, and supports multiple architectures like ARM. To get started, install the extension and create a new Linux project from the template gallery. Set breakpoints and debug just like a regular Visual Studio project. Under the hood, files are copied to the Linux machine, gcc invokes the build, and the debugger attaches. The project properties control where files get deployed and built on the remote system. Pre and post build events execute Linux commands. The extension works for IoT devices like the Raspberry Pi. The Blink sample configures GPIO pins to light an LED. For Linux desktop development, the extension can launch OpenGL applications by setting the DISPLAY variable and OpenGL dependencies.

Amazon recently expanded its Dash Button program, which allows customers to order specific products like laundry detergent by pressing a wireless button installed in their home. The program launched a year ago with buttons for about 30 brands, and has now expanded to over 100 brands including Energizer batteries, Arm & Hammer cat litter, and Trojan condoms. The Dash Button costs $4.99 but Amazon refunds that after the first use. It is only available to Amazon Prime members, who get free 2day shipping on Dash Button orders. Some analysts believe the brands are subsidizing the cost of the buttons. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has long focused on making online shopping as easy as possible. The Dash Button removes the need to order through a website or smartphone. Amazon has patented technology to ship items proactively before customers order them, and is helping appliance makers design products that can automatically reorder supplies. While convenient, the Dash Button raises concerns about unwanted orders, especially with children able to press the buttons. Customers can set a default to prevent reorders until the previous order has arrived.

Containers are lightweight and share resources. Docker containers are often compared to virtual machines, but they are fundamentally different technologies. Containers share underlying resources and build lightweight images for specific applications, while VMs include entire operating systems and are heavier. The key differences are: Containers share infrastructure like plumbing and electricity, while VMs contain their own. Containers are like apartments in an apartment building, VMs are like standalone houses. Containers allow you to deploy only what you need for an application. VMs start with a full OS and strip out unneeded components. Containers are immutable and stateless. Data lives outside containers in volumes. VMs contain app code and stateful data together. Containers are fast to spin up and optimize horizontal scaling. VMs are slower and heavier. Docker is an application delivery technology, not a virtualization technology. The focus is on deploying services and microservices that make up an app. Monolithic apps can be containerized as a first step, but microservices are better suited for containers. The key mindset shift is that Docker is about delivering applications, not virtual machines. Containers represent services rather than full systems or servers."

The article discusses different options for architecting Drupal websites and web applications. It introduces three main approaches: Coupled Drupal: Using Drupal's builtin templating with limited JavaScript. Allows marketers to build experiences without developer help. Progressively decoupled Drupal: Starts with Drupal HTML output, then adds interactivity with a JavaScript framework like Angular. Allows independent work by both Drupal and JavaScript teams. Fully decoupled Drupal: Completely separates the frontend in JavaScript from the Drupal backend. Gives independence from CMS but adds complexity. The article argues fully decoupled may not be necessary for most sites. It can lose Drupal functionality like layout management and increase developer dependence. It notes progressive decoupling provides benefits of decoupling while retaining Drupal's strengths. The Weather Channel uses this approach. Over time, better integrations between Drupal and JavaScript frameworks could encourage more fully decoupled use. But for now, progressive decoupling is often the best middle ground.

The Amazon Echo was first pitched internally in 2011. Amazon executive Dave Limp was initially skeptical about the idea, thinking it would be very difficult to develop a voicecontrolled speaker that could play music, read news, and order groceries. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos was a big supporter of the Echo from the beginning but held the team to very high standards. One major concern was latency the time for the Echo's Alexa assistant to respond to queries. The team initially aimed for 2 seconds but Bezos pushed them to hit 1 second, which seemed nearly impossible. Through extensive testing and data analysis, the team managed to get latency under 1.5 seconds. Since the Echo was an entirely new product concept, the team ran \\\"Wizard of Oz\\\" style testing where a human responded in realtime through the Echo to test different responses. Music emerged as the main use case, so the Echo focused on improving music playback and speaker quality. However, Bezos was wary of positioning it solely as a music device. The Echo ended up being one of Amazon's biggest hardware hits. It hit 1 million preorders within 2 weeks, faster than the iPhone. It was one of the topselling devices over $100 on Black Friday. Amazon sees voice as the next major computing platform. The goal is to build a voicecontrolled computer in the cloud, with the Echo being the first step."

Netflix has discovered that variation in tastes within a demographic group is much wider than differences between groups.

At Build 2016, Microsoft did not focus on Windows Mobile, instead emphasizing crossplatform development. The presenter said \\\"We don't care if it's Android or iOS, we have you covered.\\\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella now views Windows as one platform across devices, rather than separate versions. But Windows phones are still absent. It appears Microsoft is focusing more on cloud services like Azure and Office 365, and crossplatform developer tools. It aims to have apps and bots on all platforms, even without strong Windows Mobile adoption. As mobile and cloud converge, the underlying OS may become less important. If Microsoft tools and services run on all platforms, Windows Mobile could become irrelevant. This may be Microsoft's strategy going forward."

Google has launched a new healthcare information feature in India to increase access to medical knowledge among millions of people. The company previously added healthcare info to its knowledge graph in the U.S. last year. Now the feature is available in India, on Google search across platforms and the Google search apps. It provides data on over 400 health conditions in English and Hindi when searching for an illness or symptom. The feature shows information cards with typical symptoms, how common the condition is, whether it's critical, if it's contagious, what ages it affects, and more. The cards include images and can be downloaded as PDFs to share. Google will serve 'lite' versions of the cards for limited internet connections. Healthcare searches account for 1 in 20 searches, so Google aims to improve access to reliable information but notes the results aren't medical advice. In India, Google partnered with Apollo Hospitals and Columbia Asia Hospitals on the content. It also visited a clinic in Ballabgarh to understand how it could aid grassroots healthcare. The move aligns with various health startups in India working to increase healthcare access, where 97% lack basic surgical coverage. While not as comprehensive as dedicated health sites, Google's visibility means this could encourage Indians to take more interest in their health. Google wants to provide consumers with accessible information and give healthcare professionals more data on the go. It's part of Google's efforts to offer localized services in India."

Last March, IBM announced a $3 billion investment into Internet of Things over 4 years. Connecting devices to the internet is a fast growing market, projected to reach 20.8 billion connected devices by 2020. But more connections also increases security risks. Hahn's team is exploring how AI could help IoT device security. They break Watson IoT into 4 categories: connecting devices, managing/storing/transforming data, managing risks, and analyzing data. Hahn focuses on the 3rd category of managing risks. Early prototypes let device owners register devices on a blockchain and create access tiers with smart contracts. This could help prevent corporate device misuse and help regulators investigate failures. Joint device ownership could also benefit from blockchain and AI to let owners collectively agree on device state and make decisions via smart contract code.

This growth coincided with the popularization of smartphones and the migration from 2G to 3G/4G networks. Computer internet access also grew slightly from 2013 to 2014, but not as fast as cell phones. As a result, the percentage of homes using computers for internet fell from 88.4% to 76.6%. The North and Midwest regions had the highest cell phone internet usage, at 92.5% and 86.3% of homes. This is likely due to lower population density and lack of broadband infrastructure, making mobile the only option. Overall, 54.9% of households had internet access in 2014, up from 48% in 2013. Tablet usage was still low at 21.9% of homes. 54.4% of the population used the internet in 2014, up from 49.4% in 2013. Internet usage rises with income. The elderly and less educated are the majority without internet access."

Research can be challenging at agencies due to budget constraints. However, some research is better than none. Here are 5 tips to conduct research quickly: 1. Recruit via social media and pow wow for faster recruiting. Create a screener and schedule appointments in pow wow. Link to pow wow in social posts to recruit participants. 2. Conduct interviews instead of surveys for indepth insights. Surveys work for quantifiable data but interviews are better for understanding behaviors and motivations. 3. Use lightweight prototypes for testing. Options include paper prototypes, Keynote, InVision, and Hype. These are faster than fully built prototypes. 4. Do coffee shop or hallway testing on a tight budget. It's better than no testing but has limitations. 5. Use unmoderated testing like Treejack, Chalkmark, Usabilia, and Usertesting.com.

The Sugarcane Technology Center (CTC) in Brazil is developing artificial sugarcane seeds to increase productivity and reduce costs. The seeds combine genetics, disease control, vigor, and ease of planting. CTC business manager Ronaldo Onosaki explains how artificial seeds will change sugarcane production. Genetic improvement allows selection of highyielding varieties using biotechnology. CTC will offer known and new varieties with genetic purity, health, and vigor. Planting presprouted seedlings from artificial seeds eliminates transport and labor for distribution. Mechanized planting of seedlings simplifies operations, reduces equipment, and avoids nursery area. Greater genetic purity, health, vigor, and ease of planting increase tons of cane per hectare. This lowers production costs through reduced labor and equipment. Higher productivity per hectare also reduces cost per ton.

SREs balance innovation and reliability using error budgets and automation. Google's Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) philosophy has enabled the company to keep its services online and accessible nearly 100% of the time. SRE was pioneered by Ben Treynor Sloss when Google hired him to run its operations. The key ideas behind SRE are: Don't have IT specialists run operations. Have software engineers do it instead. They will build tools to automate operations tasks. Accept that 100% uptime is impossible. Instead, set an \\\"error budget\\\" like 99.999% uptime. This allows more flexibility to innovate and make changes. Hire SREs in a 50/50 split between those hired through the regular software engineering process and those with specialized ops skills like UNIX expertise. This maintains the balance between dev and ops. Cap the amount of traditional ops work SREs do at 50% to prevent them from becoming just sysadmins. Shift ops work to regular engineers if needed. Approach problems by figuring out how things could break and how to prevent that, like Margaret Hamilton did writing code for Apollo missions. The goal is to have software run itself without human operators. SREs see this automated operations approach as key to building any reliable product or service."

About the time Swift was going open source, Google, Facebook and Uber were discussing adopting Swift as a first class language. Sources say Google is considering making Swift a primary language for Android, though not initially meant to replace Java. Swift is open source, so Google could adopt it without changing Android's open source structure. Swift was introduced in 2014 as a replacement for ObjectiveC, and gained favor for being easy to write while reducing verbosity. Major apps like Lyft, Pixelmator and Vimeo have rebuilt iOS apps with Swift. However, Swift would need an Android runtime and Google would have to rewrite its standard library and APIs to support it. Kotlin is also being considered as a first class Android language. It works with Android Studio but may compile too slowly currently. Kotlin could integrate with Java more seamlessly than Swift. Facebook is interested in Swift for its ability to work on front and back end. A Facebook engineer made a pull request to port Swift to Android, though it's unclear if this is official. Uber could follow Lyft's lead in migrating to Swift for a lighter, more maintainable iOS app, though it's unknown if Lyft uses Swift on back end. The transition is not expected soon due to the monumental effort needed to support Swift on Android.

Key points: 1. R3 believes blockchain alone is not sufficient to solve many banking problems. Corda is tailored for financial agreements between institutions. 2. Corda uses blockchain concepts but is not a blockchain. It allows different combinations of blockchain properties like consensus and immutability. 3. R3 defines blockchain properties like consensus differently than public blockchains like Bitcoin. 4. The core problem is achieving consensus on the state of deals between financial firms. Corda links prose documents to smart contracts. 5. Corda has no native cryptocurrency. It supports various consensus mechanisms. 6. Corda's design has similarities to blockchains on immutability and authentication but differences like validator selection. 7. Brown shows deference to Bitcoin's architecture but argues it solves a different problem than banks have. 8. Corda enables regulator access for oversight. 9. Corda is not meant to compete with other blockchain platforms. R3 sees value in many solutions for different problems."

IBM is developing identity and contract systems to restrict data access. The leak of over 11 million documents from the law firm Mossack Fonseca, known as the Panama Papers, has exposed the offshore holdings and activities of numerous world leaders and public figures. This has resulted in calls for the resignation of several top officials. The leak raises questions about whether a blockchainbased record keeping system could have better protected the privacy of Mossack Fonseca's clients. According to IBM's Jerry Cuomo, blockchain technology needs further adaptation to fully address security and privacy concerns. IBM is working on blockchainbased identity management and smart contract systems with advanced privacy controls to restrict data access. Once commercialized, these could prevent leaks like the Panama Papers by limiting data access to authorized parties only. The existence of tax havens and confidential company ownership is a reality. If Mossack Fonseca had used secure blockchain solutions, their clients' data may have remained private. Blockchain technology offers advantages beyond privacy, including cost savings, faster settlement, lower fraud and forgery risk. Improved privacy is just one benefit of blockchain systems."

Companies have struggled to deliver compelling card + app offerings. In recent years, some payments companies have combined mobile apps with plastic cards to try to increase acceptance and use of mobile payments. Google Wallet launched a card alongside its app to extend reach and provide more flexibility. PayPal considered a similar card but focused on digital payments. Multiaccount cards like Coin allowed storing many cards on one device. Initially these card + app offerings gained some traction due to hype and marketing campaigns. But over time they faced challenges upholding attractiveness and meeting user expectations. Some companies couldn't deliver the cards, while others faced technical issues. Usage of the cards has been low in many cases. Today's impatient consumers want fast, simple payments and additional benefits beyond just a card. Mobile payments need to provide valueadded services too. Curve offers features like avoiding foreign transaction fees, using Amex where it's not accepted, and tracking spending across accounts. Plastic cards won't disappear anytime soon as more people use them. But mobile payments are the future, though still early. Banks, tech firms and governments are enabling better offerings, but the right formula hasn't been found yet.

He suggests blind evaluations to reduce bias. April 06, 2016 Mauro Cavalletti, Facebook's head of creative shop, discusses the gender imbalance in creative agency teams. He notes that teams are disproportionately male, likely resulting in advertising that doesn't represent women well. He acknowledges that meritocracy is important in competitive markets like advertising. However, he argues that creativity is often evaluated subjectively. Cavalletti shares an example of blind auditions increasing gender diversity in orchestras in the 1970s. With musicians behind screens, orchestras hired more women based on merit alone. Similarly, creative agencies could consider blind evaluations to reduce bias and hire more talented women. While merit matters, subjective evaluations of creativity may disadvantage women. More gender balance could help agencies speak the language of today's multidimensional culture better. Agencies need more female creative leaders and to promote women to gain diverse perspectives. Though the impact is uncertain, more female creatives will likely produce work more in tune with the changing world. These changes are urgent for advertising to stay relevant."

The honeycomb structures built by bees are marvels of precision engineering, with perfectly hexagonal cells gently tilted to prevent honey from spilling out. The ancient Greeks thought bees must possess geometrical foresight given by God to create such perfect structures. Charles Darwin conducted experiments to see if bees could build honeycombs using only evolved instincts, as his theory of evolution would imply. Hexagonal cells require the least total wall length compared to triangles or squares of the same area, so it makes sense evolutionarily for bees to choose hexagons to conserve wax. However, hexagonal bubble rafts also form naturally based on the physics of surface tension, suggesting bees may not need complex inherited instructions. The angles and shapes in foams and bubble rafts represent configurations that minimize surface tension and are mechanically stable. While the geometry of foam junctions is physicsbased, the overall shape of the foam is more irregular. If all bubbles were equal, the ideal cell shape is debated but is likely not perfectly hexagonal. The hexagonal combs of wasps, made of plant fibers not wax, suggest inherited instincts still play a role. Beyond foam, similar patterns emerge in biology, like the structure of fly eyes, due to the same forces. Soap film can similarly guide architectural forms that minimize total surface area and curvature. Some butterflies have gyroidstructured wing scales that produce iridescent color via light interference. The natural world exhibits a tendency to generate orderly patterns, though the specific forms result from physical forces."

Adjusting our intuitive linear expectations helps adapt to exponential technological progress. The pace of technological progress tends to surprise us because humans are not naturally accustomed to thinking exponentially. Our experience has mostly been local and linear, with little change from generation to generation. As a result, our intuitive predictions of the future are linear, expecting each day to be roughly like the last. However, as Ray Kurzweil explains in The Singularity Is Near, the rapid growth of technology is actually accelerating progress across many domains, leading to unexpected degrees of change occurring within generations. This exponential pace of progress challenges our linear intuition. Exponential growth starts out slowly before exploding upward. It is deceptive in its early stages because the initial pace seems linear. Exponential trends do not last forever, but can continue for long periods as new technologies take over when previous ones mature. Each new technology paradigm enables faster progress. Kurzweil observed this pattern of accelerating returns in computing technologies throughout the 20th century. To plan for an exponential future, we should expect to be surprised and adjust our intuitive, linear expectations accordingly. For example, it is better to forecast the next five years by considering what happened in the last five, then reducing the time it will take to make similar progress again. Exponential thinking reveals new opportunities and helps businesses, governments, and individuals adapt more smoothly to accelerating change. By becoming aware of our linear expectations, we can make better plans for the future."

Guidelines like criticizing the design not the designer can make it a rewarding team exercise. Design criticism sessions are extremely valuable for improving designs and maturing designers. However, fear of criticism can hinder the process. Participants may be reluctant to offer honest feedback and the designer may take criticism personally. This results in poor designs and strained relationships. There are several benefits to constructive criticism: It provides new perspectives, improves quality, challenges designers professionally, and builds interpersonal skills. To make it successful: Ensure all voices are heard, criticize the design not the designer, balance positive and negative feedback, and approach with humility. With practice, criticism can become a rewarding team exercise that produces better designs and stronger working relationships."

Productmarket fit still key. The article discusses two types of product virality: pull product virality (PPV) and distribution product virality (DPV). PPV refers to features where existing users need to get people in their network to join the product in order to gain value from the feature. Examples are WhatsApp group messaging, Dropbox folder sharing, and Skype video calls. DPV refers to features where existing users spread awareness of the product to their network, but don't necessarily need specific people to join to gain value. Examples are Facebook photo tagging, Instagram crossposting, and the Hotmail email tagline. PPV is more effective at converting and retaining new users, since existing users actively persuade contacts to join. It also creates network effects, as users gain value from their contacts joining. DPV creates contextual awareness and reaches a wider audience, but has less influence on converting and retaining users compared to PPV. Products can have both PPV and DPV. Facebook has photo tagging for DPV and Events/Groups for PPV. Engineering both PPV and DPV can drive growth, but requires understanding users and situations where they interact with nonusers.

Blockchain is the world's most popular Bitcoin wallet, often confused with the core innovation Bitcoin introduced. Founded in 2011, it is one of the oldest and biggest Bitcoin companies. It has passed 6.7 million users, with wallets constantly increasing. Cary says Blockchain.info allows tracking Bitcoin transactions and getting market/price information. It provides a platform for enterprises and developers to build on the bitcoin protocol. Blockchain has often represented the brand at Money 20/20. There are always blockchain discussions, and this year is no exception. Cary admits there has been a big blockchain adjustment recently. He aims to demystify Bitcoin and explain why blockchain is important. Cary says Blockchain has expanded presence and attracted new consumers in the past three years. The industry has developed following investment and human capital. He sees continued growth providing financial services to millions worldwide. Cross border payments and digital goods purchases have potential. Microtransactions are interesting but rare due to underdeveloped feestructures and scaling protocols. Cary mentions regulation as a major blockchain challenge. It's decentralized without central authority. But it's already regulated by open source nature and mathematics. Many institutions are still uncertain about Bitcoin. Companies like Microsoft and Visa are exploring but unsure of strategies. Blockchain creates tools to integrate major players. Major companies like Microsoft, Overstock, Dell, WordPress, and Wikipedia work with Bitcoin, so more may follow. Cary suggests focusing on the technology itself, which lacks morality. How people use technology matters more than the technology. Allowing anyone to easily transact is important for the Internet age. When rock and roll emerged, it was considered dangerous, but became normalized over time. An open financial protocol could open markets, decrease costs, and benefit consumers. Blockchain recently launched a major platform redevelopment and new web wallet. It plans to push updates across the platform this year. Competition from services like Google Pay and Samsung Pay will force innovation. Cary is excited about tightening competition and the innovations to come."

The article discusses the basics of implementing a Bloom filter data structure in C++. A Bloom filter can efficiently determine if an element is possibly in a set or definitely not in a set. The interface consists of a constructor, a function to add items, and a function to query if an item is possibly in the filter. It uses a bit vector to represent the filter. Key parameters are filter size and number of hash functions. More hashes reduces false positives but increases computation. The false positive rate formula and optimal parameter formulas are provided. MurmurHash3 is used to generate two 64bit hash values from the input. These are combined with the hash index to generate multiple hash values per input without affecting false positive probability. The implementation has a constructor to initialize parameters, a hash function, a function to generate the nth hash, and functions to set/check bits. With reasonable parameters, it can insert 1.8 million items in around 189 nanoseconds each. The false positive rate matches the theoretical value. Ideas to improve the implementation are welcomed."

This may address concerns over trusts' lack of transparency. Amid the controversy over British Prime Minister David Cameron's tax affairs, his 2013 intervention to block EU transparency rules for offshore trusts deserves more scrutiny. The rules would have required trusts to meet the same transparency standards as companies regarding public disclosure of end owners and beneficiaries. But now the Panama Papers are raising questions about whether trusts should be more transparent, especially for fairness in tax obligations. Blockchain technology may offer a solution, enabling trusts to be transparent while still securing holdings. Trusts are complex but work on a fundamental principle of separating beneficial ownership from legal title and property management. While public and private trusts have long shielded identities and investments, blockchain provides transparency through encrypted keys a public key to validate transactions on the immutable ledger and a private key for anonymity. So a \\\"smart trust\\\" on blockchain could maintain privacy while allowing public scrutiny. Given blockchain's very short history compared to trusts' long history, it remains to be seen how the two could work together.

Around 200 million barrels of crude oil worth $7.5 billion is stuck waiting to load or deliver. If lined up, the tankers would stretch almost 40 km. Supertanker captains report waits of 3 weeks or more at ports in China, the Middle East, and Asia. The worst congestion is in the Middle East as ports can't handle soaring oil output available for export. In Asia, ports weren't upgraded fast enough to meet surging demand as consumers buy cheap fuel. Experts say it's one of the worst tanker jams in years, caused by redhot demand from new refineries in China and inadequate port infrastructure in the Middle East and Latin America. The daily cost of the jam is $6.25 million in tanker fees. It disrupts port, catering, crew and delivery schedules and raises costs for everyone. Oil buyers lose profit if ships are stuck waiting to offload oil bought cheaply. About 50 tankers are anchored off Singapore for refueling, maintenance or waiting to deliver oil.

It makes several points: Listicles encourage laziness in readers who want simplified, predigested advice. Flooding Medium with listicles leads to less substantive content being created and suggested. Good writing should stand on its own merits, not rely on gimmicks like numbered lists. Listicles imply other approaches are wrong if not included in the list. This gives a limited perspective. Listicles overgeneralize and oversimplify. Different people have different needs and contexts. Any writing risks criticism. But listicles are especially vulnerable by their formulaic nature.

The article argues that in life we are constantly faced with decisions, and we often intuitively take the easiest path and avoid conflict or discomfort. However, the author contends that choosing the more difficult option, while uncomfortable, forces us to evolve, grow, and become better people. The author provides examples of taking the easy way out at work, like not giving tough feedback to a colleague or not informing a customer of an issue. While avoiding confrontation is tempting, having the difficult conversation makes you address problems head on, builds empathy, and creates opportunities for negotiation and creative solutions. Even though difficult conversations can be emotionally tough, the author advocates for ripping off the bandaid and addressing issues transparently as early as possible. Taking the more challenging path exercises our ability to adapt, pushes us outside our comfort zone, and prepares us to handle adversity in the future. The key takeaway is that we should be mindful of our decision making and purposefully choose the difficult path sometimes, even when it scares us. Although uncomfortable, confronting problems makes us more capable, empathetic and better able to face challenges in life."

The article discusses four types of \\\"invisible\\\" sexism that women face in their daily lives: manterrupting, bropriating, mansplaining, and gaslighting. Manterrupting refers to men interrupting women constantly in conversations and not allowing them to complete their thoughts. A famous example occurred at a 2015 panel where Google's Eric Schmidt and journalist Walter Isaacson repeatedly interrupted Megan Smith, the Chief Technology Officer of the U.S. Government. Bropriating refers to men taking credit for women's ideas in meetings. Author Sheryl Sandberg encourages women to assert themselves to combat this. Mansplaining is when men explain things in a condescending way to women, acting as if they can't understand. A CNN commentator mansplained sexual harassment to female anchors. Gaslighting is psychological manipulation to make women doubt their own sanity and perceptions. An example is dismissing women's accounts of sexual assault and claiming they are exaggerating or crazy. Recognizing these forms of everyday sexism is the first step to combatting them.

The article explains why stores like Walgreens keep inexpensive items like soap under lock and key while leaving more expensive products out on shelves. The key reason is that thieves care more about how easy it is to resell stolen goods than the retail price. Thieves sell stolen products in lowincome urban areas through fences, street vendors, friends and family networks, and online marketplaces. These thieves have a \\\"mental loot list\\\" of what sells easily, prioritizing ubiquitous household items like soap, razors, and laundry detergent over electronics and other expensive goods. While an iPhone may have a higher retail value, everyday items like soap can be quickly and easily resold on the street. Soap is in constant demand and retains its value on the black market. The article uses stolen cars to illustrate this principle. Old Hondas and Toyotas are frequently stolen because there is a huge market for their parts. Luxury cars are also targeted, but mainly by sophisticated thieves who can distribute them.

Two Brooklyn residents used the Ethereum blockchain today to facilitate a transaction that allowed one to sell excess solar energy directly to the other. The exchange was enabled by LO3, a green energy startup using blockchain for peertopeer energy trading. LO3 cofounder Lawrence Orsini said the exchange demonstrates how people can use blockchain for peertopeer exchange of assets. The joint effort called TransActive Grid, between LO3 and ConsenSys, allowed Eric Frumin to sell renewable energy from his solar panels directly to Bob Sauchelli. The energy units were logged on the Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts to make them available for sale. 195 credits were purchased for $0.07 each. Typically, Frumin would have to sell excess energy back to the utility at a wholesale price. But with this arrangement, Sauchelli will pay the full retail rate while Frumin gets the premium. For Sauchelli, the purchase process is as easy as buying from a traditional utility.

Although chatbots were discussed years ago, the launch of Facebook's chatbot API for Messenger this week marks the true start. Much of what's done with apps today will shift to bots. Vakulenko believes customer service will be early adopters, as chatbots can replace expensive 0800 phone lines with a more modern, interactive service. Startups have experimented with bots looking for a \\\"killer app\\\". As with mobile apps, this experimentation will lead to unforeseen innovations. Apps for frequent use will remain, but occasional uses will migrate to messaging platforms where engagement is easier without installing an app. There will be an ecosystem of chatbot developers, with messaging platforms thriving based on developer adoption. Disenchanted app developers are already shifting to bots. Messaging platforms will monetize by connecting users to brands and services, promoting specific bots to appropriate audiences. Facebook is the global leader, but regional leaders like WeChat, Line and KakaoTalk exist where Facebook is less dominant. Google and Apple seem to have missed the chatbot opportunity so far. Their app stores will lose importance. Chatbot stores like Slack's already exist. Discovery may happen natively within messaging apps rather than a separate store.

But it has challenges like increased bytes and lack of developer tools. The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is used for communication on the web. HTTP version 1.1 is nearly 20 years old and has performance issues in the modern web era. HTTP/2 was created to address these issues and improve web performance. HTTP/2 uses binary frames instead of text which makes debugging more difficult. Tools like Wireshark and Chrome's netinternals can inspect the binary frames. A key issue with HTTP 1.1 is latency from establishing new connections for each asset. HTTP/2 allows multiplexing multiple requests can reuse one TCP connection. This removes the need for concatenation and inlining of assets. Support for HTTP/2 is around 71% globally. Adoption is growing after support from CloudFlare and WordPress. Migrating fully to HTTP/2 may penalize older browsers, so a hybrid approach may be needed. There are still challenges with HTTP/2 increased bytes transferred from unbundling assets, the need for TLS certificates, and lack of developer tools. But it offers faster performance, especially for sites with many assets. Careful monitoring of page load times is needed when switching."

But legacy browser support and CDN limitations create deployment challenges. The article discusses how to optimize web application deployment for HTTP/2. Key points: HTTP/2 allows multiple requests over one connection and server push of resources. This changes common practices like concatenating JS files. Current best practice is a \\\"scout\\\" file that loads other resources from versioned URLs. This allows deploying app changes without redeploying server. With HTTP/2, splitting code into smaller files has performance benefits. File grouping strategy is important. File versioning should use content hashes, not integers, to avoid cache busting unchanged files. Manifest maps resources to hashes. Server push allows pushing scout file, manifest, and other resources. Need intelligence on server/CDN side. Legacy browser support requires generating separate bundles with short cache times. Manifest configures this. Tooling and CDN support lag behind HTTP/2 browser support. Frontend developers need better dev environment. Reengineering deployments for HTTP/2 requires collaboration between client and server teams."

Trello made a promise to show all cards on a board so users could see everything at a glance. But loading hundreds or thousands of cards caused painfully slow 78 second load times. For the redesign, a goal was to make switching boards fast. But browser lockups ruined the experience. The objective was to improve board load times by 10% daily for a week on a 906 card test board. On Monday, removing heavy styles like borders and shadows sped things up 7%. On Tuesday, optimizing JavaScript views instead of generating them on demand improved speed by 12%. More CSS was removed too. Wednesday was unproductive with 0% gains. Native browser APIs didn't help over jQuery. Thursday brought huge gains through preventing layout thrashing and progressive rendering. Building all card HTML upfront caused multiple layouts per card. Now card sections render separately before inserting into the DOM, preventing layout thrashing. Progressive rendering queues rendering small chunks of cards using async.queue instead of one huge DOM chunk. This allows the browser to paint quickly between chunks and prevent lockup. Other optimizations like deferred initialization and using the GPU for images helped. Bugs were fixed on Friday. Perceived rendering dropped from 7 seconds to 1 second on the large test board."

Still, many brands struggle with video content strategy. There are three main video trends to watch in the coming year: 1. Increased investment. Over 65% of major brands are shifting budgets from TV to online video. Videos are becoming a top priority over TV ads. 2. Brands as content producers. To stay ahead, companies are focusing on producing original online video content themselves, rather than relying on media. Brands can communicate directly with audiences. 3. Focus on results. Branded content for the sake of it is less relevant. Brands need data to analyze returns on video investments. Interactive, relevant content that meets consumer needs is key.

The Black Death was the deadliest pandemic in human history, killing around 60% of Europe's population in the years 13461353. It was caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, which is carried by fleas that infest black rats. The plague likely originated in the steppes north of the Caspian Sea in 1346, and spread via trade routes to Constantinople in 1347 aboard Italian merchant ships returning from Crimea. From there it spread rapidly across the Mediterranean and Western Europe, traveling at an astonishing 40km per day by ship. Its spread by land was slower at just 2km per day along major roads. The combination of maritime and overland spread, plus the high lethality of the disease, allowed it to ravage countries quickly. Mortality was extremely high, with around 50 million estimated deaths across Europe. This was partly due to the interconnectedness of trade networks, increased population density, and lack of knowledge about the nature of epidemics. Most people at the time believed the plague was divine punishment. The abrupt shifts in seasonal mortality patterns after 1348 provide strong evidence that the Black Death was bubonic plague. Key features like higher rural mortality and spread by ships also match typical plague epidemiology. Genetic evidence confirms Yersinia pestis DNA in multiple plague burial sites across Europe. While it was previously thought to have started in China, recent research indicates the plague emerged in Central Asia before spreading west to the Black Sea. The plague never managed to spread through Russia but entered Western Europe via merchant ships from Crimea. Norway, Iceland and Finland were spared due to their isolation. The Black Death marked a major turning point in European history, catalyzing social and economic changes that helped transition the continent out of the Middle Ages. Its demographic impacts were felt for centuries after the initial outbreak ended in 1353."

In a 2015 interview with AARP magazine, Bob Dylan provided insight into the demise of early rock 'n' roll, which he said was deliberately dismantled and segregated along racial lines by the music industry in the late 1950s. He explained that rock 'n' roll originally fused black and white musical styles and was highly threatening to the establishment. But payola scandals were used as a pretext to remove pioneering DJs like Alan Freed from the airwaves. Soul music then emerged as a new black genre, while the British Invasion bands became the white face of rock. Dylan saw this as the assassination of the original integrated rock 'n' roll art form. Dylan's comments shed light on tensions around rock's interracial roots and sexuality. Some black leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. disapproved of rock's overt sexuality, which impeded aspirations for integration into white society. Figures like Frank Sinatra also condemned rock's \\\"brutal\\\" sound. But young Elvis fans rebuked Sinatra for being \\\"jealous\\\" that he couldn't \\\"wiggle around\\\" like Elvis.

It risks environmental harm and distracting NASA from exploration. Space mining is no longer science fiction. By the 2020s, companies like Planetary Resources and Deep Space Industries will send spacecraft to identify and harvest valuable asteroids. This raises concerns about ownership and exploitation of space resources. The U.S. Space Act of 2015 allows companies to utilize space resources, but this may violate the Outer Space Treaty, which says space resources cannot be appropriated. Competition over asteroid minerals could lead to conflict. Valuable metals like platinum are relatively scarce on Earth but abundant in space. Commercial space mining could divert NASA's focus from exploration to profitseeking ventures. Breaking up asteroids could create hazardous debris around Earth. Alternatives include regulating space mining like Antarctica, with no territorial claims allowed. We should explore space as its steward, not repeat environmentally destructive practices. Ramin Skibba argues commercial interests could discourage public engagement with astronomy. Space mining and science would be better served by decoupling from each other."

The search for the killer chatbot is underway in Silicon Valley, but it's off to a rocky start. Microsoft's Tay chatbot was turned into a racist by Twitter users. Facebook's new bot platform also faces criticism bots seem no smarter than 1990s Microsoft Office assistants. We interviewed Facebook Messenger's David Marcus about the opportunity and criticisms. Marcus argues Facebook's bots are more consumerfriendly than commandline interfaces, with rich templates for images, text and callstoaction. He says the Wall Street Journal and Poncho bots are among his favorites. Marcus acknowledges blank message windows are challenging for novice users. Facebook added \\\"null state\\\" backgrounds and \\\"Get Started\\\" buttons to provide context and guidance. Latency is another issue Poncho took 30+ minutes to respond during the interview. Marcus says bot response times should be under 5 seconds. Infrastructure challenges remain. Marcus admits Facebook's M assistant is only used for simple tasks so far. M needs to be more proactive to build habits. Vertical bots are needed for different intents. Automated responses are increasing as the AI learns. M's calendar integration and ecosystem of bots should improve functionality over time. Overall, Marcus sees major potential in more consumerfriendly bots, but acknowledges many design and technical challenges remain in early days. Critical feedback will help drive improvement."

The lower house of Brazil's Congress voted to send President Dilma Rousseff's impeachment case to the Senate. The Senate will likely put Rousseff on trial and remove her from office, replacing her with Vice President Michel Temer. Rousseff's supporters are angry about the impeachment, while her opponents are celebrating. However, most politicians voting for impeachment are not doing so because of the charges against Rousseff of violating budget regulations. Instead, Rousseff is a weak and unpopular president, so she is an easy target for the public's anger over Brazil's poor economy. Her impeachment also distracts from a massive corruption investigation known as Operation Car Wash, which has implicated many Brazilian politicians across the political spectrum. The impeachment effort has been led by Eduardo Cunha, the head of Brazil's lower house. He is being investigated for corruption himself, so the impeachment helps divert attention from his own legal troubles. Other corrupt politicians hope Rousseff's impeachment will also reduce scrutiny on them. Prosecutors worry a new government under Temer could undermine the corruption investigation by passing laws to limit future probes or replacing officials overseeing them.

It recommends always downloading to a file before executing unknown streams in bash. The article describes a technique for delivering malicious payloads to users who pipe curl requests directly into bash. Normally curl requests display the downloaded content, but piping into bash causes the content to execute linebyline. This allows an attacker to detect when a request is piped to bash by inserting a delay command early in the script. The delay will pause execution and transmission of subsequent chunks, creating a detectable gap.

However, nanowires corrode after several thousand cycles in lithium environments. The researchers found a way to prevent this corrosion. They coated gold nanowires with manganese dioxide and replaced the lithium with an electrolyte gel. This created a protective sheath around the nanowires. With this design, the experimental battery completed hundreds of thousands of cycles over 3 months with no degradation.

When the author heard of the new Facebook bot platform, he wanted to build a bot in PHP. He started by looking for a Facebook SDK but none was available yet, so he checked the documentation which provided good information for getting started. To create a Facebook bot you need two things a Facebook Page as the home for the bot, and a webhook URL that will receive and respond to messages from users. The author created a Facebook Page called \\\"TimeBot\\\" that would tell users the current time. Next the author had to create a Facebook App in the developer dashboard that would be hooked to the Messenger platform. After getting a Page Access Token and setting up a webhook using the nGrok tunneling tool, the author was able to setup a script on his localhost that could receive and respond to messages from the TimeBot Facebook Page.

Linux Random Number Generator (LRNG) is a new approach for collecting entropy within the Linux kernel, developed by Stephan Mueller. It aims to improve on the aging /dev/random by providing sufficient entropy during boot and in virtual environments, limiting impact on parallel systems, and enabling accelerated crypto. The design goals are fully documented in [1]. LRNG has been implemented for the Linux kernel in a way that does not alter the existing /dev/random code. It can be enabled at compile time as an option. If enabled, /dev/random is not compiled, but if disabled, the legacy code compiles unchanged. This allows API/ABI compatibility with the existing implementation. Extensive testing of entropy collection and processing is documented in [1], with all test code in [2]. Performance comparisons to /dev/random show major speedups in /dev/urandom and get_random_bytes. Stability testing has also been performed on 32/64 bit systems. The code has been submitted as a patch series against the cryptodev2.6 tree to allow proper review without interfering with current functionality. The design and implementation fully meet the goals in [1], which also includes comparison to other RNG designs like SP80090B/C and AIS20/31. [1] [2]."

Depth and movement can be adjusted for desired effect. The article explains how to create a multilayered parallax illustration using CSS and Javascript. It starts by explaining how to prepare the illustration assets splitting a painting or photo into multiple PNG files with transparent backgrounds to create a sense of depth. The bottom of the image should match the background color for a smooth transition. The HTML structure consists of a parent \\\"hero\\\" container and multiple \\\"layer\\\" divs with a \\\"parallax\\\" data attribute. The CSS styles the \\\"hero\\\" container and \\\"layer\\\" divs to be fixed, full screen height. Individual classes are added to each layer div to specify the background image. The Javascript uses scroll position to calculate movement of each layer based on a \\\"datadepth\\\" value. Layers with lower values move slower, creating parallax. The movement value is applied to the CSS transform property. For mobile, parallax is disabled and replaced with a static background image for performance. Media queries toggle parallax on for desktop and off for mobile. The depth values and positioning can be tweaked to achieve the desired effect."

This allows more digits for the actual number value compared to floating point. Unum could enable more accurate calculations in fields like high performance computing. John Gustafson, a computer scientist, has proposed a new number format called \\\"unum\\\" to address limitations in how computers represent decimal numbers. The key difference with unum is that the fields representing the exponent and precision can expand or contract as needed. This allows more digits to represent the actual number value rather than reserving bits to represent the decimal point location. The current floating point format has limited precision because as the number gets larger, less space is available to represent the fractional part. Gustafson gives the example of representing Avogadro's number in unum compared to floating point. Another issue is that extra zeroes sometimes appear when shifting the decimal point, falsely implying greater precision. Unum includes a field that indicates if a number is exact or approximate to avoid this issue. The unum format is gaining interest, with Python and Julia ports already available and efforts underway for C, Java, and other languages. Adoption of unum could lead to more accurate calculations in fields like high performance computing where precision is critical."

Agile innovation methods like scrum, kanban, and lean development were created for software development. Now they are spreading to other functions like marketing, HR, and even the Csuite. Companies using agile are seeing big gains in productivity, speed, and customer satisfaction. But many executives don't really understand agile. They continue to manage in ways that undermine it, like overloading teams with projects, interfering in team decisions, and adding extra reviews. To capitalize on agile, executives should: 1. Learn the basics. Agile emphasizes empowered, crossfunctional teams; experimentation and adaptation; working prototypes over documentation; and collaborating with customers. 2. Use agile where creativity, collaboration, and adaptability are needed like new product development. It's less applicable to routine tasks. 3. Start small, often in IT. Let successes create evangelists who spread agile organically. 4. Allow experienced teams to customize practices like progress tracking as long as they improve outcomes. 5.

But the effects are smaller in the elderly who can't generate as much force. The force on a triple jumper's bones is 15 times their body weight. Bones experience huge forces during movement from impact and muscles. Even walking puts over 5 times body weight of force on bones. This force squashes, twists, and bends bones. Bones sense this and grow to reduce breaking risk. For example, tennis players' racket arm bones can be 20% wider with 40% more mineral than their other arm. But not all exercise builds bone. Swimmers and cyclists have similar bones to nonexercisers. Bones respond differently along their length more density near joints but thicker shafts. Bones also change shape from forces during growth. Less loading causes bone loss, like 1% per month for astronauts. Exercise at young ages has lasting benefits for bone size and strength. But effects in the elderly are smaller, maybe because they can't produce as much force. New techniques to study bone contortion during movement should improve exercise design for all ages. Exercise, especially in youth, can dramatically strengthen bones and reduce fractures. More work is needed to maximize benefits across different ages."

The article discusses different ways to classify and represent innovation using diagrams. It starts by describing a 2x2 diagram by Norman and Verganti that classifies innovation along the dimensions of technology change and meaning/use change. It notes limitations of this simple classification and introduces radar (or spider) diagrams as a way to represent multivariate comparisons of innovation. The article then discusses a radar diagram proposed by the Accelerated Radical Innovation (ARI) group to classify innovation along four dimensions: technology, business, commercialization, and market. It critiques some aspects of this diagram, such as the naming of levels and examples used. The author then proposes an alternative radar diagram with dimensions technology, business, sales, and market. The levels would be measured on a logarithmic scale from 15 to capture ordersofmagnitude differences in the intensity of innovation. Examples are given to illustrate how major innovations would score a 45 on this scale. The article argues that this type of multidimensional logarithmic radar diagram allows for richer classification and measurement of innovation compared to simpler models. It concludes by noting that even comprehensive models have limitations in fully capturing complex innovation dynamics."

In December 2011, the author had been working at Google for 9 years, leading a team of 10 developers supporting AdSense. They had over 30 legacy systems built over the past decade using a variety of stacks. Maintaining these systems took up 60% of the team's time. The team decided to migrate all their web apps to Google App Engine, which had just launched. They also started using Dremel (BigQuery) for data processing. This required rewriting their systems, but afterwards development was much faster with less maintenance. Over 2 years, time spent on maintenance dropped from 60% to just 5%. With more time available, the team took on larger projects and outpaced bigger teams.

It can generate new dance animations in the same style, providing creative inspiration. In 2005, Will Wright unveiled Spore at GDC and showed off its ability to procedurally generate dance animations for creatures. This seemed to excite people's imaginations, as it allowed unique dances to be generated for novel body shapes. However, Spore's creatures did not look human, so the dances were not realistic human dances. Now, using advanced machine learning techniques, computers can generate realistic, dancelike motions for a human skeleton. The software lab Peltarion has worked with Lulu Art Group to create \\\"Chorrnn\\\", a dancing human skeleton. It was trained on 5 hours of motion captured interpretive dance data, and after 48 hours of learning, could generate new dance moves in the same style. Before training, Chorrnn was just a bundle of lines. But after training, it learned to move in humanlike ways. This allows artists to get computergenerated versions of their own dance style, which they can use as inspiration to create new art to feed back to the computer. Rather than a supercomputer, it uses 4 consumer GPUs, so it's accessible to many groups. The ability to generate art removes the need for humans to do iterative work, potentially leaving only true creativity. However, it could also show how few people are capable of true geniuslevel creativity."

Science fiction movies often depict futuristic interfaces as blue. Designers Chris Noessel and Nathan Shedroff analyzed scifi movies from 19682011 and found blue to be the most common color for interfaces. Blue is rare in nature, making it seem mystical and inhuman. Scifi lets designers imagine future interfaces, but those choices also reflect the present. In early scifi there were hardly any interfaces. The first Motorola cell phone opened downwards and didn't sell well. The next model opened upwards like Star Trek communicators and was very successful. Star Trek's LCARS interface inspired the imageunderglass paradigm of modern devices, partly due to budget constraints. Interesting lessons come from assuming everything in scifi has a reason. In Star Wars, explosions are heard in space, possibly to make battles more dramatic. But sound could also represent an augmented reality interface providing 3D sound to the pilots. In 2001: A Space Odyssey, Dr. Floyd's daughter button mashes unseen video call controls. This could represent a contextaware system filtering out unwanted input from a child user.

The Washington Post revealed that nearly all examiners in an elite FBI forensic unit gave flawed testimony in almost every trial they were involved in over a 20 year period before 2000. A review by the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and Innocence Project uncovered these errors in 268 trials so far. The review raises questions about the accuracy of expert testimony presented as scientific evidence to juries. 26 of 28 examiners overstated forensic hair sample matches in ways that favored prosecutors in over 95% of trials reviewed. This led to 32 death penalty sentences, with 14 executed so far. There were no scientific standards for testing methods, yet FBI experts claimed nearcertainty of hair sample matches, misleading juries about the evidence's value. The review focuses on FBI examiners but the same mistakes likely occurred in state prosecutions relying on the 5001000 local examiners trained by the FBI. Some states will review these cases but others may not, and evidence is now lost. This highlights that crime labs and prosecutors' offices do make devastating mistakes, often not distinguishing between capital and noncapital cases. Justice Scalia has emerged as an early skeptic about the risks of taint in crime lab work, despite arguing that no clear cases have emerged of executed innocent defendants.

Choosing the right implementation is key for performance. The article discusses the Java collections framework, which provides utility classes and interfaces to represent and manipulate groups of objects. The framework was introduced in Java 1.2 and has remained largely unchanged for backwards compatibility, though Java 8 added some enhancements. The main collection interfaces are Iterable, Collection, List, Set, Map, and Queue. Iterable allows iteration with foreach loops. Collection represents a group of objects that can be added, removed, and checked for presence. List is an ordered collection indexed by integers. Set contains unique elements. Map stores keyvalue pairs. Queue is designed for holding elements prior to processing. Common List implementations are ArrayList and LinkedList. ArrayList is typically preferred over LinkedList for better performance. Common Set implementations are HashSet for unordered storage and TreeSet for sorted storage. HashMap is the most commonly used Map. ArrayDeque and PriorityQueue are common Queue implementations. The Collections utility class provides helpful methods like making collections unmodifiable or synchronized, finding min/max elements, reverse ordering, etc. Third party libraries like Guava, Eclipse Collections, Fastutil, and JCTools provide additional collection types and functionality. Upcoming Java 9 will provide simpler convenience factory methods for creating collections. Collections are a fundamental part of most Java programs.

OpenAI is releasing OpenAI Gym, a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. It includes environments like simulated robots and Atari games to test algorithms. OpenAI Gym works with various frameworks like TensorFlow and Theano. The environments are in Python but will be accessible from any language. OpenAI built Gym to accelerate their own reinforcement learning research and hopes it will help the broader research community. Reinforcement learning involves an agent learning to make decisions to achieve goals in complex, uncertain environments. It is exciting because it is very general, applying to problems like robot motor control, business decisions, and games. Recent algorithms have achieved good results without too many assumptions about the environment. However, progress is slowed by the lack of good benchmarks and standardized environments. OpenAI Gym aims to provide diverse environments from easy to difficult across areas like classic control, algorithmic tasks, Atari games, board games, and simulated robots. The environments have version numbers so changes don't affect comparability of results. Rather than traditional leaderboards, OpenAI will curate contributions that provide insights into algorithm capabilities. They want OpenAI Gym to be a community effort and are seeking feedback during the public beta. The goal is an improved research tool through community contributions of environments, reproducing results, and improving performance."

This suggests people rely more on perception than an indepth mental model for everyday objects. The article describes a series of experiments investigating people's understanding of how bicycles work. The author, a cognitive psychologist at the University of Liverpool, was interested in testing the theory that people overestimate their ability to explain how everyday objects work. In the first experiment, 64 noncyclists were asked to draw a bicycle and identify the correct parts from multiple choice options. Many participants made fundamental errors that would prevent a bicycle from functioning properly, such as connecting the front and back wheels or misplacing the pedals and chain. In the second experiment, 94 noncyclists were given hints to focus on functionality over aesthetics. However, errors did not decrease compared to the first experiment. In the third experiment, 31 regular cyclists made far fewer errors than noncyclists. In the fourth experiment, 58 noncyclists were shown a real bicycle while completing the task. With this visual aid, their performance improved to the level of cyclists. The results suggest most people, including those who can ride a bicycle, have a limited understanding of how bicycles actually work. The study also found large sex differences, with women making significantly more errors than men, even among those who cycle regularly. The author is unsure of the reason for this difference. Overall, the findings support the theory that people tend to have a shallow knowledge of how everyday objects function, relying on perception rather than an indepth mental model. The author argues this is likely an efficient strategy given the availability of visual information in the world."

Unique workplace dynamics create barriers that require a multifaceted approach to overcome. Many organizations struggle to enable knowledge sharing in the workplace despite the prevalence of sharing in everyday life. This is because workplace knowledge sharing faces unique challenges compared to personal sharing on consumer social platforms. Five key reasons employees don't share knowledge at work: 1. Sharing is not integrated into the workflow. It's an extra task, not a core responsibility. 2. Enterprise social networks lack the scale and activity of consumer platforms. This reduces the value for individual users. 3. Enterprise sharing tools are transient. They don't retain knowledge longterm like wikis and documentation. 4. There is often too little or too much structure around sharing. Employees need guidance to contribute effectively. 5. Employees lack motivation and trust. Sharing is not recognized or rewarded. Organizations can overcome these challenges by: Fostering a culture of trust Integrating sharing into daily workflows Providing rightfit technology with search and structure Supporting and recognizing contributions Getting managers to model desired behaviors Emphasizing peertopeer help as motivation Successful knowledge sharing improves problem solving, increases engagement, and captures critical expertise."

This requires marketing and IT leaders to collaborate rather than work in silos. Marketing technology spending by CMOs is predicted to surpass IT spending by CIOs in 2017 according to Gartner. As marketing activities move increasingly online, technologies like programmatic advertising, social media management, and data analytics become crucial. This has led major software companies like Oracle, Salesforce, and SAP to cater offerings directly to CMOs rather than CIOs. CMO purchases are seen as operating expenses rather than capital expenses like IT infrastructure. However, proper ROI analysis is still required despite faster purchase cycles. The explosion in marketing technology vendors and shift to cloud services places new demands on IT departments. CIOs are needed to evaluate solutions, ensure security, and manage integrations.

It takes many iterations over 10 years to build robust, featurecomplete software that large numbers of people want to use. The article warns against several common mistakes in software development: Trying to develop software too quickly without adequate time, as many dotcom startups did in the 90s.

In 2014, Facebook acquired WhatsApp for $19 billion, which sparked speculation about Facebook's vision for WhatsApp. At Facebook's F8 conference, this vision became clearer chatbots will cause disruption in businessconsumer interactions in the nearterm, and change how people interact with machines longterm. Chatbots offer a better customer experience than current options like voicebased support. They provide a standardized way to contact businesses, automatic verification, seamless transfers between experts, multimedia information transfer, and other benefits. This superior experience means businesses will adopt chatbots or lose customers to competitors who do. Beyond better customer service, chatbots allow dramatic cost savings through natural language processing (NLP) and crowdsourcing. NLP allows automated service, while crowdsourcing maintains quality by involving humans when needed. This can cut costs by around 85%. Companies can then use the direct customer dialog for marketing and sales. Longterm, the data from chatbot interactions will improve NLP engines. This will enable personal assistants that use the internet as a knowledge base for highervalue decision making. Messaging platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp will become the entry point to the internet, instead of search engines. In summary, chatbots will fundamentally change humancomputer interaction in the next 5+ years, starting with business use cases. This will lead to disruptive changes in how people interact with the internet and intelligent assistants. Chatbots have major potential for disruption on a 5year horizon."

The experiment uses random convolutional neural networks as feature detectors to generate texture from noise. Different configurations are tested, including activation functions (ReLU, LeakyReLU, ELU), downsampling strategies (average pooling, max pooling, strided convolution), number of units, and network depth. Key findings: ELU activation performs best, likely because it better preserves information. Strided convolution is better than pooling for downsampling. More units improve quality incrementally. Deeper networks degrade quality. The author speculates random networks could be useful for tasks like examplebased superresolution, but more research is needed for complex tasks like style transfer.

This enabled datadriven monitoring of growth and early issue detection. The article describes how the author built a simple Excel model to track key metrics and usage patterns for a software product they were managing at HubSpot. The goal was to be able to accurately predict weekly active users (WAUs) based on daily active users (DAUs). They recorded DAUs each day of the week, then compared to previous weeks to identify trends and ranges. This allowed them to establish a projected min and max for WAUs by midweek. The consistent weekly usage patterns enabled reasonably accurate forecasting. This model helped them monitor growth, identify issues early, and avoid false alarms. The author notes this type of quantitative analysis is key for building worldclass products, and highlights HubSpot's hiring for data analyst roles."

Their size and temperature makes them candidates for hosting liquid water and life. A team of astronomers has detected three Earthsized exoplanets orbiting an ultracool dwarf star called TRAPPIST1, just 40 light years from Earth. The planets were discovered using the TRAPPIST telescope in Chile, which is designed to focus on nearby dwarf stars and search for planets around them. The planets orbit TRAPPIST1, which is oneeighth the size of our Sun and significantly cooler, in 1.5 to 73 days. Their sizes and temperatures are similar to Earth and Venus, making them good candidates for hosting liquid water and potentially life. Because the star system is so close to Earth, scientists can study the planets' atmospheres and assess their habitability within our generation. The discovery is a major step in the search for life outside our solar system. The TRAPPIST telescope was designed specifically to observe faint, cool dwarf stars that would not drown out signals from orbiting planets like larger stars do. While risky, this approach paid off with the detection of these three potentially habitable exoplanets around TRAPPIST1."

It has digital public services, online voting, blockchainbased healthcare records, and paperless government cabinet meetings since 2000. Its most radical digital project is eresidency, which allows people worldwide to become digital residents of Estonia online. Estonia's chief information officer Taavi Kotka started eresidency to increase Estonia's customer base and tax revenue since immigration is low due to its far northern location. Each of Estonia's 1.3 million people have a digital identity card with a unique identifier that provides access to over 1,000 online public services and private sector services. Key identifying data like signatures are stored alongside the unique number, enabling digital identity verification. Eresidency is currently in its early stages with around 10,000 users so far. The goal is for eresidents to eventually set up Estonian companies online, from which Estonia collects tax revenue. Kotka has an entrepreneurial background and aims to make Estonia \\\"country as a service.\\\" Other projects include using corporate data to build economic models that predict job losses and advise local governments. The UK's lack of digital identity numbers makes true digital society impossible there, unlike Estonia where people have seen the benefits of IT and support digital solutions."

1462274233,6980529106338478812,"en","tech","Chatbot history from personality to utility Chatbots evolved from trying to mimic human conversations to focusing on utility, thanks to improved natural language processing. The 1999 film Bicentennial Man featured Robin Williams as an intelligent robot named Andrew. This inspired Robert Hoffer to create SmarterChild, an early chatbot that lived on AOL Instant Messenger and MSN Messenger in the late 1990s. SmarterChild aimed to be a useful virtual assistant that could provide information like sports scores and weather forecasts, not just hold conversations. SmarterChild was a precursor to today's chatbots on platforms like Facebook Messenger and Slack. However, modern chatbots are more focused on utility than personality. They aim to help users complete tasks, not to pass as human. In 1966, MIT's Joseph Weizenbaum created ELIZA, an early natural language processing program that mimicked a psychotherapist. Although ELIZA had limitations, some users became attached to it, contrary to Weizenbaum's intentions. He argued machines could only understand language in limited contexts. For decades, chatbot makers tried to create more humanlike interactions, inspired by the Turing test. SmarterChild straddled the line between personality and utility. It required extensive scripting and could hold conversations, but also provided useful information via partnerships. However, it faced challenges scaling up these services. After SmarterChild, consumer chatbots declined until recently. New chatbots focus on utility thanks to improved technology. Major tech companies now provide platforms and tools for developers to build chatbots. The interaction is more transactional, with less emphasis on personality. If successful, these chatbots would prove Weizenbaum right they are tools, not human replacements."

This has drawn criticism as it could hamper innovation and the use of new technologies that rely on fast internet speeds and unlimited data, such as video streaming, online gaming, internetconnected devices, big data analytics, and more. Anatel's president cited heavy online gamers as an example of data overuse, but critics say the real issue is providers' failure to invest in infrastructure and desire to limit service to boost profits. By capping speeds, Anatel risks Brazil missing out on technological advancements happening globally. Unlimited highspeed internet has become a necessity for innovation, but providers just want to charge higher prices due to increased demand.

It's unknown if Google will develop this into an actual product. Google was recently granted a patent for a delivery drone that can autonomously deliver packages and take off again. The drone would slowly lower packages to the ground using a rope and cable system. Sensors allow the drone to detect when the package has touched the ground so it can detach the cable. After delivery, the drone returns to base to recharge and pick up another package. Interestingly, the patent also describes how the drone interacts with people during delivery. It can emit verbal warnings like \\\"Beware: Move away\\\" to alert passersby. Upon completing delivery, it says \\\"Complete delivery!\\\" in a cheerful tone. The drone has color changing lights similar to a traffic light to indicate when it's safe for people to take their package.

However, few traditional companies with both online and offline presences have implemented agile across most teams. Research shows under 20% of traditional companies consider themselves mature adopters. Companies deploying agile at scale have accelerated innovation up to 80%. To facilitate agile adoption across business units, companies must modify foundational processes, structures, and relationships in four areas: 1. Adopt productoriented organizational structures instead of application/project structures. This allows stable, endtoend teams focused on business outcomes. 2. Improve businessIT interactions by designating strong product owners from business units to work closely with IT. This accelerates decision making. 3. Redefine managerial roles and responsibilities to account for differences between agile and waterfall approaches. This clarifies expectations. 4. Reconsider budgeting and planning models. Shift from annual cycles to dynamic quarterly/monthly reprioritization. This increases flexibility. Companies can use a lab approach, big bang redesign, or wave and spike approach to transform their operating models.

Exploring the Expedia site helps contextualize the data fields. Simple techniques like finding the most common clusters don't perform very well. Machine learning also doesn't work well due to the large dataset size, high number of clusters, and lack of linear correlations. A better approach is aggregating hotel clusters by destination ID and finding the top clusters. This results in far better accuracy. The forums reveal a data leak that allows matching users across the training and test sets. Combining this with the top clusters method and submitting would result in a top 15 leaderboard entry. The key steps were exploring the data, iterating quickly, figuring out local accuracy, reading all materials thoroughly, and trying various techniques beyond just machine learning. Writing efficient, fast code and finding ways to improve speed are critical. Future improvements could explore user/destination similarity, better combining of predictions, and more regional analysis."

Asia Pacific leads the world in mobile phone and wireless internet usage, but attracts less than a third of global mobile marketing spend. The region's mobilefirst consumers have fueled doubledigit sales growth for tech companies, twice the pace of traditional retailers. Differences between Asia Pacific and North America: Asia Pacific tech companies rely less on advertising revenue than Western counterparts like Alphabet and Facebook. Popular Asian apps like WeChat incorporate ecommerce and payments, unlike Western social media apps. Western companies are now adding ecommerce features, but these remain experimental. Pursuing alternative revenue streams risks complicating the user experience. Recent funding trends show enterprise software, agency services, and financial services gaining traction in Asia Pacific. Indian company Ola, an Uber competitor, recently launched a payments service after raising $500 million. Practo Technologies, an enterprise healthcare platform, now facilitates medical appointments after raising $90 million from Google Capital and others. This is Google's largest Asia Pacific tech investment, signaling larger deals ahead. Horizontal integration will be key as competition tightens. Asia Pacific's localized startups like ServisHero and RedMart are masters of specific audiences and services.

This informs their thumbnail design to help people find content quickly. Netflix uses data analysis to optimize how images on thumbnails illustrate movies and series in order to capture users' attention. Some key findings from their A/B testing: Images with 3 or fewer characters perform better than group shots. This gives users a better idea of the movie/show. Complex emotions like surprise or anger generate more clicks than stoic faces. Images with villains perform better than heroes to grab attention, especially for kids and action titles. Different images work better in different regions based on cultural nuances. More conceptual arts work in some areas, while action shots work better in others. The goal is to help users find something to watch quickly. But choosing solely by image can be misleading. Other factors like creators, context, and reviews matter too.

To implement agile across business units, companies must modify structures and processes in four key areas. Many digital companies are using agile software development to deliver products and services more efficiently. However, few traditional companies with both online and offline presences have implemented agile across most teams. Research shows under 20% of traditional companies consider themselves mature agile adopters. Companies deploying agile at scale have accelerated innovation up to 80%. To facilitate agile adoption across business units, companies must modify foundational processes, structures, and relationships in four areas: 1. Adopt productoriented organizational structures instead of application/project structures. This allows stable, endtoend teams focused on business outcomes. 2. Improve businessIT interactions by designating strong product owners from business units to work closely with IT. This accelerates decision making. 3. Redefine managerial roles and responsibilities to account for differences between agile and waterfall approaches. This clarifies expectations and responsibilities. 4. Reconsider budgeting and planning models. Shift from annual cycles to more dynamic quarterly/monthly reviews and continual reprioritization. Companies can use a lab approach, big bang redesign, or wave and spike approach to transition to agile. Risks exist, but standing still in a digital business world is also risky. Companies must adapt to extend agile capabilities across all functions."

Deep neural networks are transforming the internet by powering artificial intelligence systems like image recognition, speech recognition, and language translation. Companies like Google and Facebook are leading this AI revolution by hiring top researchers and engineers. However, even the best researchers need to try countless unsuccessful options before finding an AI model that works. This trialanderror process requires massive amounts of computing power. To accelerate AI progress, companies are now focused on automating parts of this trialanderror process. Facebook engineers built a system called Flow that allows any engineer at the company to easily build, test, and execute machine learning models at large scale. This system enabled Facebook to increase the speed at which they deploy new AI models into their products. Facebook has also built systems like AutoML and Asimo that use AI to help build AI models with less human effort. Asimo can even generate improved versions of existing models automatically. While not yet capable of inventing wholly new types of AI algorithms, automating parts of the AI development process will enable faster innovation. By reducing the grunt work required, more engineers can work on solving challenging problems and top researchers can focus on pushing the cutting edge."

The article discusses how notifications on phones are outdated and often not helpful or relevant to users. It outlines how notifications could be improved by using data about user behavior and context to make them smarter and more personalized. Key points: Notifications are often poorly timed, irrelevant, and overwhelming. This causes frustration and disengagement. Algorithms and machine learning can analyze user data like location, usage patterns, interests, and social connections to predict when and how to best notify someone. Future \\\"smart notifications\\\" could have better timing, grouping, targeting, reactions, and conversational messaging. Feedback loops would still be needed to account for deviations from predicted behavior. The data needed to create smarter notifications already exists from widespread social media and app usage.

In a talk at the NYC Lisp meetup, Gerry Sussman explained why MIT stopped teaching 6.001, the legendary course based on Sussman and Abelson's classic text Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP). Sussman said he and Abelson got tired of teaching it after doing so since the 1980s. More importantly, they felt the SICP curriculum no longer prepared engineers for modern engineering. In the 80s and 90s, engineers built systems by combining simple, wellunderstood parts, which SICP's goal was to provide abstraction for reasoning about. Today engineers routinely write code for complex hardware they don't fully understand due to trade secrecy. The same goes for software built on enormous libraries. Programming today is more like science you grab library code, poke at it, and tweak it to do what you want. The SICP view of building larger systems from smaller simple parts became irrelevant. Now programming is done by poking. Python was chosen for its many libraries applicable to diverse projects. Sussman admitted SICP was more coherent but they still don't know the right curriculum. SICP's text and 1986 video lectures are available online."

The article gives an overview of the new Activity and Fragment transition APIs added in Android 5.0 Lollipop. Transitions in Lollipop are built on top of the transition framework introduced in KitKat. The framework is based on the concepts of scenes (UI states) and transitions (animations between scenes). When a scene changes, the transition framework automatically captures the start and end values of views and creates an animator to transition between them. This allows easy animation between activities/fragments with minimal code. The article then explains some key terminology: Calling activity The activity that starts another activity Called activity The activity started by the calling activity Exit transition Animation when calling activity exits Enter transition Animation when called activity enters Return transition Animation when called activity returns Reenter transition Animation when calling activity reenters There are two types of transitions: Content transitions Animations for nonshared views entering/exiting activities Shared element transitions Animations for shared views transitioning between activities Steps to implement activity transitions: 1. Enable transitions with Window.FEATURE_ACTIVITY_TRANSITIONS 2. Set content and shared element enter/exit transitions 3. Start transition with startActivity() and ActivityOptions.makeSceneTransitionAnimation() 4. Call finishAfterTransition() to return The fragment transition API is similar, with some small differences.

The author's team built a model to predict host acceptance from trip characteristics like checkin/out dates and number of guests. They used mean acceptance rates as proxies for preferences to reduce noise, and imputed missing data. The predictions were combined into a logistic regression model. In online A/B testing, the model increased booking conversion by 3.75%. After optimizations, it was launched sitewide. The project showed personalization can be effective on both sides of a twosided marketplace."

Tensorflow wins We started developing Leaf briefly before Google released Tensorflow. For two weeks, Leaf seemed to have unique capabilities. We wanted to give developers tools to build machine learning applications, not just scientists. Although Leaf had great performance and API, it couldn't compete with Tensorflow. Leaf's theoretical benefits are less significant than the practical benefits Tensorflow provides over earlier frameworks like Torch, Caffe, and Theano. The next generation of developer tools for machine learning will build on Tensorflow or higherlevel frameworks like Keras that abstract over multiple AI engines. When we started Leaf in November, this trend was less clear. Now with tools like Tensorflow and Keras, venture capital is flowing into AIdriven applications instead of infrastructure. We wanted Leaf to be the top framework for developers, but it won't gain traction outside Rust. So we're suspending Leaf development to focus on new ventures. I'm staying in startups and AI, working with a VC on an early stage investment fund. Thank you to our 4000+ GitHub stars and almost top 1000 project. We're grateful and will give back with future projects."

This addresses the growing workload from more scans. Jeet Raut and Peter Wakahiu Njenga cofounded Behold.ai to use machine learning to analyze medical scans and catch abnormalities faster and more accurately than humans. This helps address the problem that the number of scans radiologists must review has tripled since 2012, making it impossible to carefully review each one. The idea came after Raut's mom received a false negative diagnosis for breast cancer. Raut studied at Columbia, Illinois, and Stanford, while Njenga worked at Facebook after studying at Columbia and Berkeley. Behold.ai is 85% accurate at identifying problems in scans during initial testing. The algorithm improves over time as it reviews more data. The startup is in talks with hospitals about possible partnerships to implement the technology, though it faces competition from IBM Watson and must get FDA approval.

The Houaiss Dictionary, one of the main Portuguese dictionaries, recently changed the definition of \\\"family\\\" in order to expand its meaning to include diverse modern family structures. The old definition focused on a traditional nuclear family of parents and children living together. The new definition describes family as a social group united by emotional ties, shared space, and mutual support. This change was made as part of the All Families for Change project, a campaign promoting inclusion of diverse family types like samesex parents. The campaign partners with LGBTQ organizations and challenges Brazil's proposed \\\"Family Statute\\\" law which would limit family to heterosexual unions. The dictionary editors worked with Brazilian families to craft a new definition reflecting the reality of families today.

A new \\\"Swarm Intelligence\\\" platform called UNU from Unanimous A.I. made shockingly accurate predictions for the recent Kentucky Derby horse race. The platform allows groups of people to come together online as a \\\"swarm\\\" to make collective predictions and decisions. This is inspired by how groups of animals like birds, bees, and fish use \\\"swarm intelligence\\\" to make optimal group decisions. UNU made headlines recently by predicting Oscar winners and NCAA games better than experts. When challenged to predict the Kentucky Derby, UNU users narrowed the field to 4 horses and predicted the exact order of finish. The odds of picking this \\\"superfecta\\\" were 540 to 1. The UNU users who participated individually only predicted the winner 23% of the time. But together as a swarm, they were 100% accurate. This shows an \\\"amplification of intelligence\\\" of 435% over individual predictions. UNU has outperformed polls, surveys, and prediction markets. This is because human swarms can explore decisions together in realtime, converging on optimal solutions, just like real animal swarms. Now with UNU, any human group can tap into swarm intelligence to amplify their collective brainpower."

Researchers at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich conducted an experiment to see how readers perceive computergenerated news articles versus those written by journalists. 986 participants were asked to read and evaluate online news stories. Some were written by journalists and some by algorithms, but this was not always disclosed to the participants. Articles believed to be written by journalists were rated as more readable and credible than computergenerated ones, even when the \\\"author\\\" was actually an algorithm. However, computergenerated articles were seen as more credible than those truly written by journalists. Researchers believe this is due to the precise facts and figures included. Overall, while humanwritten articles were preferred for readability, the differences were relatively small. This suggests computergenerated articles on topics like sports and business may already appeal to readers. The study demonstrates readers' perceptions can be swayed by whether they believe an article is written by a human or computer, even if that attribution is false.

Blockchain workflow tools improve efficiency for incumbent banks and firms. The article explains the difference between bitcoin and industry workflow tools, which are both referred to as \\\"blockchains\\\". Bitcoin is a disruptive innovation that allows for direct peertopeer electronic payments without financial institutions. Its purpose is financial inclusion. Industry workflow tools like R3's Corda aim to improve efficiency for incumbent institutions. Their purpose is to maintain competitive advantage. Calling both \\\"blockchains\\\" is confusing, just as calling Twitter and Microsoft Sharepoint \\\"database companies\\\" would be misleading. The financial industry was not interested in bitcoin but became interested in the technology behind it. Some bitcoin companies rebranded as blockchain companies, further confusing matters. Now the term blockchain is used for everything from replacing banks to making them more efficient. The conflation of terms has created an echo chamber of hype and confusion. Bitcoin provides financial inclusion; industry workflow tools provide efficiency gains for incumbents. The benefits and use cases are very different. Incumbents should use workflow tools for efficiency but will likely not be disintermediated. They should also defend against bitcoin disruption by trying to compete on its terms. Disruptors should keep improving public blockchains and not lose focus trying to solve incumbent problems. There is excitement for the future as disruptors and incumbents continue on their separate paths. Eventually the disruptive technology will likely win out."

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broad term that refers to making computers act intelligently. It encompasses many subfields like robotics, machine learning, natural language processing, and more. Popular examples of AI include Apple's Siri, selfdriving cars, and Facebook's image recognition. But AI also powers things like product pricing, movie recommendations, predictive maintenance, and fraud detection. Companies don't \\\"buy\\\" AI solutions. Rather, they leverage subfields of AI like machine learning. Machine learning focuses on training algorithms to learn from data, complete tasks, and make predictions. It relies on statistical accuracy rather than rules defined by humans. Machine learning algorithms are developed using libraries in programming languages like Python and R. Machine learning has limitations though. The models can make predictions but don't explain the reasoning behind them. This is where machine intelligence comes in. Machine intelligence aims to interpret data and explain why predictions are made. It allows humans to understand the models and connections in the data. An example is predicting next month's electric bill and explaining that it will be higher due to weather, travel schedule, and AC issues. Machine intelligence is key for generating actionable business insights from AI. Some companies have oversold their AI capabilities, exploiting ambiguity around terms like machine learning versus machine intelligence. Machine intelligence represents an exciting progression in AI where models not only predict outcomes but also teach humans the reasoning behind those predictions and enable better decision making."

Introduction Over the past few weeks I've been exploring deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). One influential paper is Google's Multidigit Number Recognition from Street View, which describes a system to extract house numbers from street view images using a single endtoend neural network. The same network can break Google's own CAPTCHA system with humanlevel accuracy. To gain handson experience with neural networks, I decided to design a system for automated number plate recognition using Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, and NumPy. My reasons were: 1) The Google architecture should work well for reading number plates too. Having a known good architecture simplifies things as I learn about CNNs. 2) I can easily generate training data since UK number plates are uniform. This avoids needing hundreds of thousands of real labelled images. 3) It's interesting to see what I can achieve with minimal domain knowledge and code vs traditional systems with thousands of lines. Inputs, Outputs and Windowing The network operates on 128x64 grayscale input images to simplify training and reduce computation. A sliding window approach checks different scales to detect plates in larger images. The outputs are: Probability a plate is present Probability of each digit character (7 total) I determine if a plate is present based on its size and position in the image. Synthesizing Training Images I randomly generate 128x64 images of plates on car backgrounds from the SUN database. The plate text, color, noise etc are randomized to simulate real images. The plate undergoes affine transformations like yaw and scale. The Network Architecture The CNN architecture is based on a paper by Stark et al. It has convolutional and pooling layers, plus fully connected layers at the end. The output layer detects plate presence and character probabilities. Training takes around 6 hours on a GPU. Output Processing To detect plates in real images, the network is applied as a convolutional network to different windows and scales. Nonmaximum suppression combines duplicate detections. The detector successfully recognizes plates in most test images. In one case it misreads an 'R' due to differences from the training font. Conclusion In around 800 lines of code, I built an ANPR system with minimal domain knowledge and no domainspecific libraries. I avoided the need for thousands of training images."

This makes it very difficult for small, indie developers to succeed in the App Store, which is biased towards established brands that users recognize and trust. The data shows a similar pattern in app downloads, with 70% coming from the top 1% of developers. In summary, the App Store heavily favors major developers and makes it challenging for smaller developers to compete."

Elasticsearch has many ways to query, filter, and aggregate data. Often there are multiple approaches to solve the same problem, with very different performance. Understanding how filters work is key to optimization. Filters should be used when possible, as their results can be cached. Queries should be used when scoring is needed. Putting a filter in the wrong place, like a post_filter when no aggregations are present, can hurt performance. Filters should be combined with bool and ordered by selectivity. Some filters can't be cached, so consider adding cacheable \\\"accelerator\\\" filters to reduce the search space first. Aggregations can be expensive. Consider reusing cached filters or skipping aggregations when possible. Scoring happens in phases reduce the search space before expensive scoring computations. Avoid deep pagination which requires scoring many results. Optimize your mappings to support the searches you need. Avoid scripts in searches when possible. Do not try to optimize a single search at the expense of overall performance. Test optimizations in isolation and measure overall impact. Focus on actual bottlenecks, not just theoretical optimizations."

It achieves stateoftheart accuracy and speed. Google has open sourced SyntaxNet, a TensorFlowbased dependency parsing library. SyntaxNet provides neural network models for syntactic parsing published by Google researchers over the past two years. Syntactic parsing identifies the grammatical structure of sentences, which helps applications reason about language. The release of SyntaxNet is important because syntactic parsing is a bottleneck in natural language processing. The neural network models in SyntaxNet significantly advance the speed and accuracy of parsing. The first SyntaxNet paper in 2015 used a larger network and better optimization to achieve gains over prior Stanford and spaCy parsers. Subsequent SyntaxNet papers further improved parsing accuracy through more principled approaches. The flagship SyntaxNet model, Parsey McParseface, achieves over 94% accuracy at 600 words per second. This is stateoftheart accuracy, slightly ahead of other recent models. The real significance is the rapid advancement in natural language processing enabled by neural networks. Many ideas previously unworkable are now viable. The transitionbased neural network architecture pioneered in SyntaxNet provides a clear path forward. For example, joint modeling with other tasks like semantics, and semisupervised learning from unlabeled data. In summary, SyntaxNet represents an important milestone due to enabling faster, more accurate parsing. This will unlock new natural language understanding applications. The release provides a strong foundation for further advances in neural networkbased parsing."

This enables Java development for the web without plugins. JavaPoly.js is a JavaScript library that allows Java code to run in web browsers without needing Java installed. It serves as a polyfill, extending native Java Virtual Machine support to browsers. Developers can import existing Java code and invoke it from JavaScript. This finally allows Java to run directly in browser script tags instead of only in applets. The project lead, Jim Sproch, says any JVM language like Groovy and Scala could theoretically run using JavaPoly.js. Even Python could potentially run using Jython. The main goal is enabling Java web development. The JavaPoly.js developers are building native JVM plugins for Chrome and Firefox and hope to standardize the API through a standards body. JavaPoly.js will run in any modern browser even without browser vendor support, but native support will make it much faster. Better browser integration is critical for performance, as running code in a native JVM bypassing JavaScript allows utilizing computer hardware more fully. The developers hope browsers will someday support all JVM opcodes natively. JavaPoly.js seeks to overcome limitations of JavaScript like lack of design and quick initial development. In contrast, Java was more holistically designed by engineers for features like threads, 64bit integers, and type checking. This makes it more suitable for large applications. The JavaPoly.js developers have dealt with JavaScript's slow performance and lack of parallelism by calling into native JVMs when available. JavaPoly.js is currently in early beta and will have a general release once the API stabilizes per developer feedback."

The article discusses some common mistakes that Java developers make when first starting to write Python code. The author looked at a 45,000 line Python GUI app written by Java devs and found many inefficiencies. In Python, static methods should be modulelevel functions, not classmethods. Classmethods have extra overhead. Method chains and dotted names also have runtime lookup costs. Switch statements should be hash tables in Python. Multiple ifelse blocks should also be hash tables if possible. Python dicts are highly optimized. Avoid XML when simpler Python code will do. XML is better for interoperability than core functionality in Python. Avoid getters and setters until you prove you need them. Use properties instead. Use closures instead of duplicating code. Write a function that returns a function to capture common code. The author advises Java devs learning Python to stop writing so much code. Lean on Python's capabilities more. The solution is often already there in the language or standard library. This is known as \\\"Guido's time machine\\\". Overall, do not trust your Java instincts when writing Python. Python has very different best practices. You will likely be far more productive in Python if you learn idiomatic Python code."

It recommends using Babel and Rollup for compiling. The ES2015 (ES6) specification was approved in 2015 and brings many new JavaScript language features. Node.js v6 supports 93% of ES6 features thanks to the V8 v5.0 engine. Using ES6+ syntax has benefits like more readable code and faster development compared to relying on polyfills. For new npm modules targeting Node.js v6, it's a good idea to publish an ES6 version for Node 6 users and a transpiled ES5.1 version for Node 0.x/4.x/5.x users. Also useful is an ES6 version using module syntax for bundlers like Webpack. To do this, the source can be in ES6+ in a `src` folder. Babel and Rollup can compile it to CommonJS bundles for Node 6, legacy bundles for older Nodes, ES modules, and UMD bundles. The `package.json` can point to the different bundles. A `build` script can run Babel and Rollup. This allows publishing the modularized and compiled bundles to npm. The boilerplate code demonstrates this build setup.

Understanding prototypes helps avoid issues. JavaScript was originally designed to implement prototypebased objectoriented programming (OOP), which is conceptually different from classbased systems like Java. Prototypebased OOP had been invented to solve problems with classbased OOP. However, JavaScript was marketed as \\\"Java's little brother\\\" so prototypebased OOP was made to look like classbased OOP with the 'new' keyword and constructor functions. This has led to confusion among developers. In prototypebased OOP, objects inherit directly from other objects through their prototype chain. There are no classes or blueprints. New objects can be created simply by cloning existing objects and modifying them. This is done in JavaScript with Object.create(). The prototype chain allows inheritance through delegation when a property is accessed on an object, the JavaScript engine traverses up the prototype chain looking for the property, until it is found. The constructor function pattern in JavaScript obscures prototypal inheritance, making it look more like classbased OOP. However, this can lead to unexpected behavior compared to proper classes. Understanding prototypal inheritance helps avoid issues. Prototypebased OOP is conceptually simpler, more flexible and dynamic than classbased OOP. However, many developers are still unfamiliar with it. To work effectively in JavaScript, it's important to understand prototypebased programming."

Regulators are examining how insurers use data. They may issue guidance or intervene if needed. Data protection laws limit what insurers can do. Legal risks must be discussed at the board level. A top challenge is having skilled people to properly capture and analyze big data. Asking the wrong questions or using data incorrectly can lead to poor decisions. Overall, big data looks set to significantly change the property insurance industry."

Critics worry it enables authoritarian surveillance, though the founders believe stopping tech progress is futile. A new Russian face recognition app called FindFace allows users to photograph strangers in public and identify them by matching to profile pictures on Vkontakte, a Russian social network. With over 500,000 users, FindFace has processed nearly 3 million searches in 2 months. The app was created by Artem Kukharenko and Alexander Kabakov. The app uses a fast algorithm to search large databases and find matches with 70% accuracy. Users can find social media profiles of people photographed on the street or in crowds. This raises privacy concerns, as it enables clandestine photography and tracking of strangers. Some have used it to identify and harass women online. The founders envision law enforcement and businesses using the technology for surveillance. They are in talks with Moscow's city government to match CCTV footage to wanted lists and social media profiles. Retailers could also target ads to customers identified in stores via the app. Critics worry the technology enables authoritarian monitoring of citizens.

The article discusses what makes a cool URI (uniform resource identifier). A cool URI is one that does not change over time. URIs should not change just because an organization changes its website structure or layout. When a URI changes, it breaks existing links and damages the organization's reputation. To create persistent URIs, avoid including changeable information like author names, subjects, status, access levels, file extensions, software mechanisms, and disk names. Instead, start the URI with a creation date, which will not change. The domain name should also be stable over time. Organizations should design their URIs carefully at the outset for longevity.

He sees value in exploring alternatives even if they don't prove superior. Back when Mike Cohn was writing his book on agile estimating in 2005, he had already been studying estimating for 5 years. He felt he had learned enough to write the book, but wanted to learn more about teams using different approaches than he advocated. Some teams were using task points to estimate sprint backlog items along with story points for product backlog. This intrigued Mike since he was already a proponent of story points. He couldn't see the value of using task points as well. To learn more, Mike visited teams using task points. He found task points were nearly identical to story points just a more granular unit. Teams wanted a smaller unit to better track sprint progress. Introducing a more granular unit was a good idea for many teams. However, Mike found hours already provide a more granular unit familiar to all team members. Product backlog items are estimated by multiple team members, but sprint tasks are done by individuals. So it's less important for the whole team to agree on task estimates. The person doing the work can provide the estimate. Mike finished his research unconvinced of the value of task points over using hours for sprint task estimating. He continues to advocate commitmentdriven sprint planning using hours for most teams. Some teams use estimates as just a planning tool and discard them, or don't estimate at all. Either approach works once a team has experience. Mike was glad to research task points as an alternative approach, even though he was disappointed it didn't prove better than existing methods.

Spotify initially had a traditional centralized operations team that fought fires and handled all operations tasks. The operations team built tools like ServerDB to track machine details and Fully Automated Installer (FAI) to install machines. Engineers requested capacity increases via tickets that took weeks or months to fulfill. The operations team started with some minimum viable products (MVPs) to reclaim time for bigger projects: Automated DNS zone file generation and pushes to reduce errors Automated machine ingestion into ServerDB using serial numbers instead of humanassigned names Automated provisioning requests by looping a script to retry failed installs These reduced engineer wait times from weeks to hours. The operations team then built a selfservice web portal called Sid. Sid issues jobs to Neep for installs, recycling, and power cycling with high reliability.

Swarming helps organizations adapt. The ability to quickly find, share, and connect with relevant expertise across teams is a major challenge for large organizations seeking agility. Traditional knowledge management systems assume knowledge can be extracted from individuals and stored, but complex work requires conversation and relationships. HR systems are too administrative and rigid for today's dynamic work. Social tools like Yammer break down silos but rely on serendipity. The solution may come from nature and the swarm intelligence of bees. Bees collectively identify nest sites without central control. People are not preprogrammed like bees, but we can learn from swarm behaviors like seeking diverse knowledge and encouraging competition of ideas. The key difference is humans need motivation to collaborate. Skill swarms are selforganizing groups that form around shared interests and skills to work together. Skillhive uses skills, interests, and social rewards to connect people to swarms. It recognizes and rewards inspiring ideas and helpful expertise. Swarming enables agile collaboration without bureaucracy. Experts predict swarming will become more common as work becomes more dynamic.

The article discusses how to perform joins between tables using Android's ContentProvider API. It shows an example with two tables sport and team. To join them, the query builder's setTables() method is used with the join syntax: \\\"team LEFT OUTER JOIN sport ON (team.sportId = sport._id)\\\" Since the tables have some columns with the same name like _id and name, a projection map is needed to create aliases. For example, sport.name is mapped to sport_name. The projection map is set on the query builder using setProjectionMap(). When retrieving results from the cursor, the aliases are used instead of the full column names. For the list adapter, the UI is bound to the aliases like name and sport_name. In the detail fragment, the projection uses the full column names but results are retrieved by alias. This allows performing a join between tables using the ContentProvider while avoiding conflicts between samenamed columns. The outer join ensures teams without sports are still included.

At QCon London 2016, Eric Evans, author of Domain Driven Design, Tackling Complexity at the Heart of Software, advocated using the concept of Domain Driven Design (DDD) to reduce the complexity of the ubiquitous language in microservice environments. In microservice environments, ubiquitous languages between teams create issues since teams develop their own languages within their domains, leading to inconsistent meaning of concepts like \\\"customer\\\" across teams. This results in misunderstandings and errors in requirements and code. Evans suggests using three DDD tools to manage a microservice environment: context map, anticorruption layer (ACL), and interchange context. A context map represents communication paths between microservices and suggests interactions between teams. An ACL translates external concepts into an internal model to decouple domains. Interchange context provides a layer for teams to align meaning and translate languages. Migrating from monolithic to microservices shifts contextual complexity to between services. This new context must be managed or the system could become an unclear \\\"big mud ball\\\". Evans suggests designing each microservice as a limited DDD context to bound microservices in functionality and language. This makes each team responsible for a part of the system, producing more understandable and maintainable code."

The goal is to make the web more accessible by letting any device have a web address that can be discovered and accessed on the fly. This is important because as more smart devices proliferate, requiring a unique app for each one is impractical. The Physical Web enables simple interactions without an app, unlocking many new use cases. It builds on existing standards like Bluetooth beacons and WiFi to broadcast URLs that nearby devices can pick up. While not meant to replace native apps, it removes the need for an app just to get basic info or perform quick actions. The Physical Web has potential to enable a \\\"long tail\\\" of modest interactions across many devices. It is open source, with initial implementations by Google, but others are encouraged to join. It can be tried on Android/iOS today. Developers can get started broadcasting URLs using the Eddystone beacon format. Overall, the Physical Web aims to fulfill the web's potential for interaction on demand, without friction."

It builds on the Smart Reply feature in Gmail. Google has developed new AI technology called Smart Reply for its new messaging app Allo. Smart Reply uses neural networks to understand the context of a conversation and suggest relevant responses to the user. It is similar to the Smart Reply feature in Gmail. The Smart Reply team started exploring conversational AI about a year ago. They experimented with encoderdecoder neural networks like those used in Smart Reply for Gmail. A key challenge was meeting the low latency requirements for messaging apps. To address this, they developed a twostage model. First, an RNN encodes the conversation context into a vector. Then a second RNN uses this vector to generate a specific response, one word at a time. Beam search is used to efficiently explore the space of possible responses. There were several engineering challenges to make the system fast and high quality at scale. The team evolved the architecture to reduce latency below 200ms. They also implemented techniques to control response length and introduce diversity. The suggestions are personalized over time to match the user's style, using a user embedding vector. This personalization scales to millions of users thanks to an efficient LBFGS based technique. The model is languageagnostic. A graphbased technique connects similar responses across languages, enabling transfer learning. This allows scoring variants of each response to promote diversity.

The Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is a crowdfunded project that has raised $150 million so far, making it potentially the largest crowdfunded project ever. Unlike traditional crowdfunding campaigns, the DAO does not produce concrete products or services yet. Instead, it aims to be a new way of allocating capital through the collective wisdom of stakeholders rather than traditional fund managers. The DAO has around 11,000 anonymous stakeholders who can vote on proposals to spend the organization's funds. Companies or individuals submit funding proposals which stakeholders can vote to adopt or reject. Stakeholders earn profits from adopted proposals. The DAO is funded entirely by the cryptocurrency Ether, which has exploded in value recently. Ether's growth is partly fueled by hype around the DAO itself. The DAO now accounts for 14% of the value of all Ether. Ether and its underlying Ethereum protocol enable the DAO through smart contracts that execute automatically without human intervention. However, Ether's rapid price increase gives token holders incentive to withdraw their funds after the lockup period ends, which could dent the DAO's value. Still, supporters believe the DAO represents a future without middlemen through decentralized governance.

1463922214,-1753606726398516179,"en","tech","Discussion on Swift vs ObjectiveC highlights differences in tools and approaches An analysis of discussions between ObjectiveC and Swift experts shows the languages have different strengths. Swift is more static while ObjectiveC offers dynamic capabilities. There has been recent discussion about Swift's effectiveness. Brent Simmons, an expert ObjectiveC developer, has written about his experiences with Swift. He notes that many useful ObjectiveC tools are missing or clumsy in Swift, like responder chains, runtime function adding, and selector reflection. However, many iOS developers may not use or know about these advanced ObjectiveC features. So they may not share Simmons' frustrations. The dynamic nature of ObjectiveC exists in UIKit, even if you write in Swift, as Craig Hockenberry has pointed out. But many newer ObjectiveC developers, especially on iOS, don't utilize the language's dynamic features. Features like swizzling methods, checking respondsToSelector, and bindings in Interface Builder are often unknown. There are two reasons for this: 1. Knowledge about ObjectiveC's dynamic capabilities is underdocumented and explained only in outdated places. 2. Apple has deemphasized the dynamic side of ObjectiveC in iOS tools, unlike OS X tools. Small changes like compiler warnings, generics, and instancetype returns have also nudged ObjectiveC towards being less dynamic. So it's understandable iOS developers don't know about these powerful features, since Apple discourages their use. Experts like Simmons and Hockenberry provide valuable perspective on relying on ObjectiveC foundations. But reinventing that dynamic system in Swift may not be needed. Swift is far more static, so different tools could be better suited to solve problems in a new context. The goal should be growing your tool set to choose the best tool for each job, not finding one perfect tool. We don't need to portray Swift as superior in all ways, or vilify ObjectiveC. Sharing knowledge and learning from each other, while building software, is what matters."

But some see quality and experienced talent sustaining agencies. The Brazilian advertising market is facing a crisis that began before the current political crisis. Two recent texts from advertising professionals Pyr Marcondes and José Eustachio provide insightful but differing perspectives on the challenges facing the industry. Marcondes' researchbacked analysis sees major disruptions to the traditional agency model due to factors like pressure for new compensation models, a disconnect between clients and agencies, unqualified professionals, and a deteriorating public image. Eustachio offers a more optimistic view, arguing that despite many challenges, talented people will sustain the industry going forward. Inspired by both views, the author imagines opening a new, smaller agency focused on quality over scale, experience over pose, partner equity, simpler facilities, and building brands rather than just buying media. Key principles would be transparency, objectivity, and moving beyond just advertising to serve clients' broader business needs."

The article details how browsers now allow developers to automatically add content to a user's clipboard after certain events. This could allow malicious actors to trick users into running unwanted commands. For example, a website could entice a user to copy an innocent looking command. If the user tries to copy it, a timer overrides the clipboard with malicious code. When pasted into the terminal, the malicious code executes without the user reviewing it first. More sophisticated payloads can hide their actions, like creating hidden files or clearing the terminal. This method could be combined with phishing to trick users into running dangerous commands.

It allows reordering operations on differently typed data. There were concerns that typebased alias analysis in GCC could cause problems, but the GCC developers concluded that most code was already compatible since other compilers had implemented this optimization earlier. Typebased alias analysis means that each memory location has a type, and you can only access that location using a compatible type. For example, a variable of type int can only be accessed through an int* pointer. This allows optimizations like reordering operations on differently typed locations. You can bypass the rules using unions or character pointers for type punning. For example, a floating point value can be negated by accessing it as a union with an int and flipping the sign bit. Allocated memory doesn't have a static type, so writes set the effective type. This allows tricks like writing as int then reading as long to work, but can have surprising optimizations. The standards leave some ambiguity about how strictly to enforce typebased aliasing with allocated memory."

The company now serves 2 billion text translations per day across 40 languages and 1,800 language pairs. Almost half of Facebook's 2 billion users see translations each month. Facebook initially used Bing because it didn't have its own translation technology at the time. However, Bing was not optimized for informal language used on social media. So Facebook developed its own system and compared it to Bing for specific languages. When its system outperformed Bing, Facebook switched over. The translation system is now fully rolled out. Facebook's goal with translation is to break down language barriers and help people connect across cultures. More social connections keep users engaged on the platform.

While early prototypes are at the low end of potential efficiency, researchers believe nanoscale structures could enable bulbs to reach 40% efficiency with excellent color rendering. This new technology could finally replace incandescent bulbs over 130 years after Thomas Edison's original patent."

This hints at how multichannel experiences may become standard. Last year, the author wrote that the Big Reverse of the Web would force a rearchitecture of the web to optimize digital experiences for new platforms like voice assistants. The author believes conversational interfaces like Amazon Echo are proof this is happening. New user platforms emerge every 510 years and cause shifts in underlying web technology. The last was mobile. Conversational interfaces like Echo could be next. The author predicts optimizing for voice/chat will be standard in a decade. Convenience will be a key differentiator. Users may never look at a website, just ask questions and get personalized results via voice. To prototype this, the author's team built a Drupal 8 demo for a fictional supermarket chain called Gourmet Market. It lets users ask Alexa what's on sale. Alexa talks to Drupal via APIs. Changes are reflected instantly without programming expertise. Users can also get notifications when an item goes on sale. On the technical side, they taught Drupal to handle Alexa Skills and respond to voice commands. The author is excited about how new platforms will change web development. The Drupal community should consider multichannel customer experiences."

Enjoei has received over $45 million in investments from funds like Monashees and Bessemer Venture Partners. The company predicts it will start making a profit in 2017. Enjoei operates on a marketplace model where small merchants sell their products on the site and Enjoei takes a commission. This model is expected to generate $115 billion in Brazil by 2018. Marketplaces like Mercado Livre are often profitable since they don't have the costs of storing inventory and shipping products. In contrast, conventional online stores like B2W and Cnova operate at a loss. B2W and Cnova are now shifting to the marketplace model by allowing third party sellers on their sites. But the transition is challenging since they were born as retailers. Chinese retailer JD.com provides a good example of successfully shifting to a marketplace model.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a hot topic in the tech world, but there is confusion about what it actually means. At Google's recent I/O conference, many attendees struggled to define AI when asked. Some described it as machines becoming more intelligent than their programming, while others focused on \\\"machine learning,\\\" a subset of AI. According to Google's Greg Corrado, machine learning involves training computers to learn and make judgments based on data, rather than directly programming them. For example, an image recognition system is trained by analyzing many labeled images so it can learn to recognize new images. This is done through neural networks designed to mimic the human brain. Neural networks have many simple \\\"neurons\\\" that each make small judgments about tiny pieces of data. Together, the neurons can make sophisticated decisions. For image recognition, one set of neurons scans pixels to judge shapes and colors, passing conclusions to other neurons, which eventually determine what object is depicted. Machine learning works well for tasks like image and speech recognition. For more complex goals like booking movie tickets, AI handles the natural language processing to understand the request, while other code retrieves the actual data needed. AI has great potential, but still struggles with many human behaviors. Overall, there is excitement about AI's capabilities, but also confusion about exactly how much today's systems can truly think and reason independently."

As a result of the increased focus on gender equality and fluidity, there has been a major shift away from institutions dictating employee dress toward more personal expression. Last December, the New York City Commission on Human Rights announced guidelines expressly prohibiting enforcing different dress requirements based on gender. The effect is that dress is now open to individual interpretation rather than institutional control.

This helps differentiate Progressive Web Apps from the flaky legacy web. The article explains why AppCache is not a sufficient solution for \\\"offline\\\" web experiences compared to Service Workers. AppCache allows caching documents for offline use, but has limitations: The FALLBACK section is the only way to do routing, which requires a request to fail first. This means users wait a long time on a flaky network before getting routed. The cache has size limits, so only a small set of URLs can be cached directly. This requires carefully curating what gets cached. AppCache does atomic updates, so the cached URLs need to change infrequently. These limitations mean AppCache only works for trivial cases. Service Workers don't have these problems and allow building complex offline web apps. The key benefit of Service Workers is reliable performance like native apps. Native apps always start quickly when tapped. The legacy web can take minutes to fail to load. Service Workers let web apps start reliably fast too.

Apple acquired a UKbased AI startup called VocalIQ last year that has technology far superior to Siri and other digital assistants like Google Now, Amazon's Alexa, and Microsoft's Cortana. VocalIQ's AI was over 90% successful at completing complicated voicebased tasks while the other assistants only had a 20% success rate. VocalIQ worked by having contractors from Amazon Mechanical Turk feed it thousands of realworld queries to train it. This context learning allowed it to have humanlike conversations and remember information instead of just doing single search sessions. The AI could be trained for any task, like controlling email while a phone is in a pocket. It also filters background noise well to precisely understand the user's voice. VocalIQ considered itself a success when users could complete tasks without looking at a screen for confirmation. It's unclear when Apple will integrate more of VocalIQ's capabilities into Siri. One source thinks it may happen slowly over time. But Apple now has the technology to significantly improve Siri's accuracy, context learning, handsfree use, and integration into new products like cars. This acquisition shows Apple is serious about competing in AI and voice computing, areas where some have doubted its efforts compared to rivals like Google."

People lost more trust in the AI after it made mistakes compared to the more forgiving response to human errors. Researchers at the University of Wisconsin recently conducted a study to see how people react when artificial intelligence systems make mistakes compared to human advisors. 160 college students were asked to schedule hospital rooms relying on advice from either an \\\"advanced computer system\\\" or a human specialist. After 7 of 14 trials, the advisors gave faulty advice. At the start, people trusted both advisors equally. But when the computer made a mistake, people lost trust and ignored its advice in later trials consultations fell from 70% to 45%. The human advisor was forgiven reliance only dropped about 5% after the error. The findings suggest potential efficiency gains from workplace automation could be lost if people lose trust after AI mistakes. While we expect flawless performance from basic automated systems, AI will make more errors forecasting uncertain situations. Study author Andrew Prahl says this is a psychological issue people need to understand AI can't be right all the time, like human colleagues.

While Agile allows for faster development like a person running at 32 km/hr, DevOps enables even faster development, like driving a Ferrari at over 320 km/hr. A key aspect of DevOps is automated provisioning, but this is just one small component. Achieving the acceleration of a Ferrari requires fundamental changes beyond just new tools. For over a decade, IT has tried adopting Silicon Valley's agile methodologies to increase speed. But the tech startup community found Agile alone insufficient, so they started combining it with automation in a softwaredefined environment known as DevOps. DevOps is the materialization of Agile as it combines automated delivery, testing, and management tools with a softwaredefined operating environment. Some key changes needed for effective DevOps: 1. An integrated service model focused on business services and continuous delivery rather than functional silos. 2. Crossfunctional teams responsible for endtoend application delivery for each business service. 3. A highly automated, elastic management framework focused on business metrics rather than technical metrics. DevOps standardizes the development environment for easier monitoring and control. It maintains developer autonomy without complete disconnection. Remember DevOps requires new practices like continuous small deliveries, dedicated crossfunctional teams, loosely coupled architecture, continuous integration/testing, and close collaboration between users, operations, and developers.

Researchers at Pohang University of Science and Technology in South Korea have developed a smart contact lens with integrated circuits that can monitor blood glucose levels and deliver drugs to treat diabetesrelated eye diseases. The lens connects wirelessly to a pair of eyeglasses that provide power and twoway communication. The soft hydrogel lens contains a glucose sensor, microchip, drug reservoirs, and inductive coil for wireless power transfer. When glucose levels rise, the sensor alerts the eyeglasses to light an LED. The user can then command the glasses to trigger the chip to release drugs from the reservoirs on the lens. This ondemand drug delivery could treat diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma, the top causes of vision loss from diabetes. Tests showed the glucose sensor was accurate for three weeks. With multiple drug doses, the lens could be used for up to a month before needing replacement. The researchers have patented the design, which could offer a convenient alternative to painful finger pricks and eye drops for diabetics if proven safe and affordable.

In 2011, SocialWire (later renamed Manifest) raised $2M from top Silicon Valley investors. The startup helped online retailers personalize shopping when customers signed in with Facebook. However, it was hard to convince retailers to add their product recommendations and not enough customers wanted to sign in with Facebook while shopping. With most funding still available, Manifest pivoted to use its technology to dynamically generate personalized Facebook ads for retailers instead of product recommendations. This new direction resonated more with retailers, and the company was eventually acquired by Rakuten. Finding productmarket fit is hard and most startups fail while searching for it. Serial entrepreneur Marc Andreessen introduced the concept of productmarket fit as the moment when a startup's product starts to gain traction and achieve sustainable growth. Successful companies usually go through several pivots across customers, problem, product, technology and growth channels to find productmarket fit. Growth marketers approach experiments like scientists developing hypotheses, running tests, and scaling successes. This process can be applied across all startup functions. The Pivot Pyramid provides a framework for systematically running experiments and making changes across the key areas of a startup to drive growth. The stages are: Customers: The core of a startup. Impacts everything else. Problem: Pivoting the problem impacts product, tech and growth. Solution: Build a product that resonates better than competitors. Tech: Enable the solution. Don't let it hinder growth. Growth: Test new tactics as old ones saturate. Key takeaways: Start with customers and problem. Changes at bottom impact top more than vice versa. Focus on one core customer type early on. All experiments should target growth. Successful pivots balance methodical experimentation across all startup functions to find productmarket fit."

The author shares lessons learned from facilitating over 30 design sprints with corporate clients in New Zealand. He outlines common obstacles faced when running sprints in corporate environments and provides solutions. Key obstacles include: Securing meeting space can cause drama with other teams. Solutions: Get executive support, hide the room from the booking system, or keep moving rooms. Getting fulltime commitment is hard. People have other meetings and tasks. Solutions: Compress or break up the sprint over multiple weeks. Some participants are skeptical or hostile to the process. Solutions: Interview everyone beforehand, let skeptics just provide expertise then leave. Facilitators shouldn't be responsible for deliverables. This causes problems when progress is slow. The team should own outcomes. The \\\"corporate immune system\\\" fights change, especially from outsiders. Solutions: Get executive support, share progress transparently, use internal spokespeople. Ambiguity is seen as weakness, even though it's normal. Solutions: Focus on testing and data to reduce ambiguity. The sprint team itself is key. Prepare them for obstacles through interviews and aligning on principles. The process highlights obstacles to innovation that executives may be blind to.

The pharmaceutical and medical products industries are facing major external changes, including sustained global demand, accelerating cost pressures, growing complexity in emerging markets, and disruptive new technologies. In this environment, pharma and medical device companies need to transform to thrive, yet research shows only 20% of healthcare industry transformations succeed. Interviews with four executives who led transformations emphasize four key practices for success: 1. Communicating openly and regularly with employees to maintain a sense of direction. Lack of direction can lead to change fatigue. 2. Leading by example at all levels of management. Middle managers and frontline supervisors especially should model desired behaviors. 3. Engaging employees through constant communication about the vision and programs. This is critical to mobilize the organization. 4. Fostering continuous improvement by scrutinizing daily work and finding ways to improve. This sustains transformation momentum in a volatile environment. Many companies face change fatigue after mergers, restructuring, and other transformations.

While the interface was familiar, getting thousands of employees to shift their work habits was challenging. Riccio says implementing the technology itself was straightforward. The main issues were around security, infrastructure, and bandwidth. The real effort had to be focused on changing employee mindsets and getting buyin. Employees were stuck in the present, focused on daytoday work rather than thinking about working more efficiently through new technology. There was also resistance from leaders who feared change and the unknown. Absurd situations arose due to restrictive policies that limited how the new tools could be used.

Mobile apps often lose a large portion of users within the first few days after installation. This is frequently due to apps requesting too many permissions upfront without explaining why they need access. Apps should strategically request permissions only asking for critical permissions upfront and secondary permissions later when needed. Asking for permissions in context when a user tries to access a feature is more likely to get permission granted. Apps should explain why each permission is needed, either through naming the feature or providing more context. Providing background images and priming users before the system permission request also improves chances of getting permission. If a critical permission is denied, the app should explain why it's needed and provide a link to change settings. Following these best practices for requesting permissions at the right times and explaining why they are needed can improve user retention."

Challenges remain around pricing, store formats and business model alignment. Walmart entered Brazil in the 1990s with high expectations to dominate the retail market like it does in the US. However, 20 years later it has struggled to gain significant market share and profitability. Some key challenges Walmart faces in Brazil: Difficulty adapting its EDLP (Every Day Low Price) model to Brazilian consumer culture which is more focused on promotions. Strong established competitors like Carrefour that aggressively defended their market share. Lack of integration between its acquired regional chains like Bom Preço. Betting on Sam's Club format that has not taken off compared to the growth of Atacarejos. Large store formats (average 2,800 sqm) that are expensive and less convenient than small stores. Lower sales per sqm and employee than competitors. High executive turnover with 4 CEOs in 8 years. Walmart has tried to react by closing underperforming stores, investing in ecommerce, and changing leadership. But structural problems remain around business model, pricing, store formats. Success in Brazil will require strategic changes aligned with the local consumer."

Researchers from MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) have created an algorithm called MemNet that can predict how memorable or forgettable an image is, almost as accurately as humans. The algorithm also creates a heat map for each photo that identifies the most memorable parts. Potential applications include improving ads, social media, teaching resources, and personal memory assistants. The team has also published the world's largest image memorability dataset called LaMem, with 60,000 annotated images. MemNet uses deep learning techniques and neural networks to find patterns and correlations on its own, without human guidance. It was trained on tens of thousands of images scored by humans on memorability. In tests, it performed 30% better than existing algorithms and close to average human performance. The algorithm also provides insights into human memory showing memorable images may improve people's memory more than expected. Next steps are to predict memorability for individuals, and tailor the system for specific industries like retail and logos. The research helps understand what visual information people pay attention to."

NIH syndrome refers to the tendency to automatically reject ideas or solutions that were developed by someone else or another group. Jobs was willing to embrace the graphical user interface developed at Xerox PARC for the Apple Lisa and Macintosh. Ive drew inspiration from the designs of Dieter Rams at Braun. Neuroscience research suggests that NIH syndrome stems from the greater mental effort required to process and understand external ideas versus one's own ideas. The brain also does not get the same rewarding release of neurochemicals when accepting others' ideas compared to generating our own ideas.

Drupal 8 core includes RESTful Web Services modules that provide a basic CRUD REST API for content entities out of the box. However, core REST has limitations like lack of support for configuration entities, file attachments, revisions, etc. The contributed RELAXed Web Services module extends core REST to add support for translations, revisions, file attachments, and crossenvironment UUIDs. This is useful for content staging and deployment across environments. The Services module in Drupal 8 allows you to create custom endpoints and support configuration entities.

This upholds the norm that reimplementing APIs for interoperability is legal, benefiting open source developers. Pamela Samuelson, a professor at UC Berkeley, argues that Google's fair use victory over Oracle is good for open source developers and the software industry. Oracle claimed Google infringed copyright by using parts of the Java API in Android. A jury just ruled this was fair use. Samuelson says Oracle's position would have harmed open source developers, who often need to reimplement APIs for interoperability. The norm for decades has been that reimplementing APIs is lawful. Court rulings agree interfaces are unprotected by copyright due to functionality. The appeals court misinterpreted these rulings, but the jury has now clearly ruled this was fair use. Open source developers can breathe easier knowing they can reimplement APIs they need for interoperability. Google's win does not mean anyone can take whatever they want from open source projects. Others would still have to defend fair use like Google did. But the norm that independent reimplementation of APIs is legal and good policy is affirmed. This benefits the industry and public by enabling competition and choice."

The article discusses Backend For Frontends (BFF), an architectural pattern used in microservice architectures. A BFF is a backend service that provides a custom API tailored to a specific frontend client or interface. Some key points: In a microservice architecture, having a general purpose backend API can become bloated as it tries to satisfy multiple frontend clients. BFFs avoid this by having a dedicated backend per client. BFFs are owned by the same team that owns the frontend client. This increases autonomy and enables the API to evolve with the frontend. BFFs are useful when frontend clients have different requirements, like mobile vs web. The custom APIs can be tailored to each platform. BFFs aggregate calls to downstream services. A single call to a BFF may fan out to multiple services. BFFs reduce coupling between frontend and backend teams. The frontend team can own the BFF and evolve it independently. There are different options for handling crosscutting concerns like auth and logging across BFFs, such as shared libraries or separate edge services. BFFs provide flexibility for frontend teams to decide where logic lives on client or server. BFFs make most sense when frontend clients have divergent needs. For webonly, other UI composition options may work. In summary, BFFs allow tailored APIs per frontend and increase autonomy for UI teams, making them useful for microservice architectures."

Google's cloud service lags far behind competitors like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure in hiring enterprise salespeople, according to a research note by Evercore analyst Ken Sena. Currently, Google Cloud Platform has only 80 open sales jobs compared to over 300 each at AWS, Azure, and Salesforce. Sena estimates Google's sales costs are just 8% of total operating expenses, versus much higher portions at other enterprise players. He argues Google's cloud investments seem more focused on technology than sales, potentially limiting growth with large business customers who rely heavily on sales staff. \\\"Google's Cloud investment seems more focused on tools and infrastructure versus the sales headcount needed to help Google garner greater Cloud market share,\\\" Sena wrote. He says this makes AWS's business less threatened by Google than previously thought. Unlike consumer products, enterprise technology sales depend heavily on a strong sales culture. AWS's recent $400M deal with Salesforce required many enterprise salespeople. Google's total cloud expenses were $1.9B in 2015, expected to reach $3.4B in 2016 far below AWS's $6.9B in 2015 and projected $9.1B in 2016. Still, Google is investing significantly in its cloud business under new leader Diane Greene. Its technical capabilities and pricing remain competitive advantages.

This allows optimizing driver staffing. Demand forecasting is critical for businesses to determine the resources needed to meet future demand. For example, restaurants need to forecast customer traffic and orders to know ingredient needs and staffing levels. Typically forecasting relies on intuition or rules of thumb, but machine learning provides a datadriven quantitative approach. With enough historical data, machine learning can be applied to demand forecasting. As an example, a taxi company in New York could forecast rider demand based on day of week, weather, and historical ride data. Using public NYC taxi and weather datasets in Google BigQuery, a benchmark model based on average demand is compared to a neural network machine learning model. The neural network model achieves substantially lower error, demonstrating it captures nonlinear effects of weather on rider demand. Once trained, the neural network model can rapidly forecast demand for future dates. This allows the taxi company to optimize driver staffing.

Deep neural networks can learn complex functions for solving nonlinear problems, but training them is challenging due to the vanishing gradient problem. As networks get deeper, backpropagation becomes less effective at updating weights. Deep learning techniques help address this by providing better ways to initialize weights, extract features, and propagate gradients. For example, convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) use receptive fields as feature detectors that create feature maps, providing meaningful inputs to feedforward networks. Through convolutional and pooling layers, ConvNets can learn hierarchical feature representations that are invariant to scale and translation.

This risks lower quality and compatibility until standards mature. Motorola's new Moto Z phone does not have a 3.5mm headphone jack. Instead, it uses USBC for audio output. This means that billions of existing headphones with 3.5mm jacks will require an adapter to work with the phone. The quality of that adapter will be critical, since it will contain the digitaltoanalog converter (DAC) and amplifier that are normally inside the phone. These components convert the digital audio signal to analog and make it loud enough to hear through headphones. Different DACs and amplifiers impact sound quality, even with the same headphones and music tracks. With USBC and Lightning ports, the DAC and amplifier move from the phone into the adapter or headphones. Audiophiles using highend headphones will likely be fine, since headphone makers can optimize the components for their products. But people using cheaper headphones could suffer worse sound for the same price when the DAC and amp are put into budget models. Pushing these components into headphones could also reduce battery life compared to having them optimized inside the phone. Additionally, the industry is still developing standards for USBC audio. Solutions from companies like Intel could allow analog audio output through USBC in the future. But by removing the headphone jack now, Motorola and others risk needing to change approaches again down the road.

There are now over 200 subscription price points and more flexibility around pricing changes and tiers. Territory pricing is also now available. Search ads are coming to the App Store, but will be limited to one ad per search, clearly marked, and only in search results. Ads will be relevant, use a secondprice auction model, and have strong privacy protections. App discovery is improved with an overhauled Featured section, the return of Categories, and other changes designed to help users find apps. These represent significant evolutions of the App Store to better serve users and sustain indie app development. Subscriptions in particular could enable more professional iPad and Mac apps. The improvements reflect Apple's increased focus on the App Stores under Phil Schiller's leadership."

It emphasizes getting the people, processes, and products right first before expanding into full digital banking. The article discusses how to build a new digital bank. It emphasizes starting with the basics of people, process, and product. For people, focus on identifying customer needs and determining where human interaction is most valuable versus automation. Build processes to connect customer journeys to digital foundations. Define products to compete with other digital startups but maintain a human touch. Structure the bank around front office (people), middle office (process), and back office (product). Get the people, process, and product right first, then build out the digital bank on those foundations. The core message is that digital banking still requires a human focus. Leverage automation, but use it to enable more meaningful human connections. Build digital products tailored to customer needs.

This made it seem inactive and caused a 47% drop in users. The article describes how Icons8 redesigned one of their services for requesting icons and lost 47% of its users as a result. The old \\\"Request Icons\\\" feature allowed users to request icons they needed and others could vote on the requests. Icons8 would draw the most popular requests daily. This was working well and usage was steadily growing. They redesigned it to look more modern and simple, and added paid \\\"fast track\\\" and custom icons options. However, the redesign removed key elements that showed the service was active and working, like visible vote counts and comments. After the redesign, icon requests and votes dropped 50%. The new design didn't make it clear the service was active and working through elements like vote counts. Removing descriptions also reduced motivation to vote. The article concludes the redesign oversimplified things and made the service seem inactive. Key details that showed it was a \\\"live\\\" community were removed.

It has basic abilities and an active community improving its humanlike conversation skills. The Mycroft AI system was created by Joshua Montgomery as an open source alternative to proprietary voice assistants like Siri and Alexa. Montgomery was inspired by scifi depictions of intelligent computers like Star Trek and wanted to make a system that could understand natural language commands to control smart home devices. After finding no good open source options, Montgomery built the Mycroft software platform and created a crowdfunded Kickstarter campaign for a reference hardware device to showcase it. The device has a friendly, scifi inspired design reminiscent of robots in movies. It runs on a Raspberry Pi and Arduino and can take voice commands, provide information, and control internetconnected devices. Mycroft is powered by open source software including Ubuntu, Mimic texttospeech, and Open Speech Recognition. The goal is to create a strong AI capable of humanlike conversation by breaking down human skills and abilities into discrete parts that can be replicated in software. Mycroft currently has basic capabilities like telling jokes and providing information, with dozens of open source developers working to improve it. The company wants to avoid AI being controlled by large tech firms and hopes to build an open community around Mycroft as it works towards a humanlike digital assistant. While true strong AI does not yet exist, Mycroft aims to demonstrate humanlike conversation abilities in the AI XPRIZE competition by 2020. The platform currently only supports English but plans to expand to other languages. Mycroft does not currently plan to release new hardware but is open to partnerships to bring its AI to new devices."

It complements coverage analysis and TDD. The article discusses mutation testing, which is a technique for evaluating the quality of a test suite. Mutation testing works by making small semantic changes (called \\\"mutants\\\") to the production code, such as inverting an if statement, to see if the test suite detects the change. If a test fails on a mutant, it is said to have \\\"killed\\\" the mutant, which is good. If no test fails, the mutant \\\"survived\\\", indicating a gap in test coverage. The article describes an open source Java mutation testing tool called pitest that was demonstrated at a conference. Mutation testing has been around for a while but is gaining more interest now. It helps address a limitation of coverage tools, which only verify code execution but not whether the tests actually check the right things.

This provides developers with a new monetization model in addition to ads, onetime payments, and inapp purchases. Apple will give developers 70% of subscription revenue the first year, and 85% thereafter. Google has not announced its revenue share yet. This will allow some apps like corporate apps, professional apps needing frequent updates, and games with online worlds to better monetize via subscriptions. Subscriptions will have consumer protections like requiring acceptance of price increases. There will also be subscription management pages. Developers can offer free trials up to 7 days for monthly subs and 30 days for annual. But developers are wary since Apple's vague rules mean uncertainty whether a subscription will be approved. This is bad for developers planning subscriptiononly apps. It's also concerning for users who may lose app functionality if they unsubscribe. Subscriptions are becoming more common for software like Adobe and Microsoft Office. iOS and Android apps may follow suit, for better or worse.

A team of Cornell University students has developed an AI application called TrueRatr that attempts to detect sarcasm in product reviews. The goal is to filter out sarcastic reviews in order to show a product's \\\"true\\\" rating. TrueRatr was created by an interdisciplinary team of Cornell Tech students mentored by Christopher Hong of Bloomberg, who had previously researched sarcasm detection for his master's thesis. The key technique used by TrueRatr is detecting \\\"sentiment shift\\\" the use of both positive and negative words in the same phrase. This indicates sarcasm more reliably than just looking for cue words. The team crowdsourced a dataset of 1,188 sarcastic and nonsarcastic Amazon reviews to train the model, which uses a random forest algorithm. On a test set, it achieved 75% precision at detecting sarcasm. The students implemented TrueRatr as a web tool that analyzes Apple App Store reviews. It filters out reviews it deems sarcastic and shows the app's adjusted rating. While it shows promise, TrueRatr's performance on real app reviews is still imperfect. Screening out sarcasm sometimes distorts ratings up or down. More training data and testing would be needed to further improve the algorithm. By open sourcing TrueRatr, the students hope to get more feedback to enhance sarcasm detection. It represents an initial step toward the difficult goal of reliably identifying sarcasm in text."

The Hadoop distribution market has consolidated to a battle between Cloudera's CDH and Hortonworks' HDP distributions. Many companies previously offered Hadoop distributions, including Amazon, Cloudera, Hortonworks, IBM, MapR, Pivotal, Teradata, Intel and Microsoft. Competition leads to better products, but open source projects are supposed to cooperate, not compete. Vendors argue open source enables easy migration between products, but Hadoop distributions have diverged, making migration difficult. Hadoop is not a single product but a framework of modules like HDFS and MapReduce. The term \\\"Hadoop\\\" also refers to the wider ecosystem like Hive and Spark. So \\\"Hadoop\\\" is not as replaceable as customers may think. HDP and CDH don't cover the same packages and module versions. This \\\"versionitis\\\" contradicts open source ideals.

Apple has created a new proprietary file system called the Apple File System (APFS) that works across all Apple platforms including macOS, iOS, watchOS and tvOS. APFS supports both Flash and SSD storage. One of the most notable features of APFS is space sharing, which allows partitioned drives to dynamically share free space between partitions as needed. For example, if you had a 500GB drive split into two 50GB partitions, and one partition was nearly full while the other was barely used, APFS would allow the full partition to utilize the free space available across both partitions. This removes the rigid limits of partitions. APFS also saves storage space by not duplicating files. If you copy a file, the copy simply accesses the original file data. Only changes to the original file are stored separately. This makes copying more like versioning. Encryption is built into APFS at the core, allowing for encryption down to the individual file level. Apple created APFS to replace the aging HFS+ file system that has been around for decades. HFS+ was not designed for modern systems and became bloated over time as new features were added. APFS was designed to be more nimble and avoid the technical debt that plagued HFS+. For average users, APFS along with macOS Sierra's iCloud storage features will automate most file system management. But APFS also has features to appeal to power users."

This has some privacy issues since data becomes public. The author recently built a voice memo progressive web app that stores data locally without a backend server. To share data between devices, the app needs a way to sync data. The author came up with an idea to use WebTorrent to let users share data peertopeer by generating a torrent link. The author added WebTorrent to the voice memos app and made it seed the audio files. When the user clicks share, it generates a custom URL with the torrent info. When this URL is opened on another device, it parses the torrent data and uses WebTorrent to fetch the file from peers. This allows syncing the voice memos between devices peertopeer without a backend server. It scales well for sharing with multiple people. The author acknowledges this approach has privacy issues since the data is public. But it shows the potential for syncing web app data without a server. More work is needed to handle private data."

Each client writes its own library for consuming a service. Microservice architectures aim to provide benefits like better scaling, high decoupling, improved resilience, technology freedom, and component reusability. However, they also introduce complexity around deployment, integration, and distributing business logic. A common question is how to avoid duplicating code across services while maintaining loose coupling. There are two poor solutions: Allowing services to depend on each other, which harms decoupling, or mindlessly copypasting code, which is tedious and errorprone. The better approach is for each client to write its own client library for consuming a service. This preserves loose coupling while avoiding duplication. An example illustrates this using a simple UserService built with Spring Boot. The service returns User objects. Two clients, a DashboardService and NotificationService, consume the UserService. Rather than copypasting User code, they use a lightweight UserClientLibrary to parse responses. This client library approach provides many benefits. The UserService remains decoupled. Client services own the library code. There is no duplication. New UserService versions don't break clients. It's fast to integrate the service. This approach has been proven successful in realworld projects. The Spring Boot example shows it is simple to implement. In summary, client libraries balance code reuse and loose coupling in microservices."

Solutions were accounting for review time, requiring summaries, and pinging developers. The article discusses the importance and benefits of code reviews in software development. Code reviews involve systematically examining code written by someone else to find mistakes and improve quality. There are various ways to do code reviews, such as pair programming, walkthroughs, and formal inspections, but pull requests on GitHub are a common modern approach. The author argues code reviews matter because they limit risks, dramatically improve code quality, make everyone on the team better, and help developers become familiar with parts of the codebase they don't directly work on. However, doing good code reviews requires planning time for them, providing context on what the code aims to achieve, and actually asking specific people to review. The author reflects on a retrospective his team did to improve their code reviewing process. Key issues were developers not taking time to do reviews, lacking context on the purpose of code changes, and not being asked directly. Solutions were accounting for review time in schedules, requiring summaries in pull requests, and pinging developers to request reviews. The author concludes code reviews are essential for high quality software and teams should customize their process."

The article discusses generative models, a type of unsupervised machine learning technique that involves training models to generate new data similar to a dataset they are trained on. Generative models hold promise for teaching computers to understand the world by learning the natural features and patterns in data like images, videos, sounds, and language. The article provides an example of using generative adversarial networks (GANs) to train a model to generate realistic synthetic images. The GAN framework pits two neural networks against each other a generator network that creates images from random noise vectors, and a discriminator network that tries to determine whether images are real or fake. By competing against each other, the two networks drive the generated images to become indistinguishable from real images. Examples demonstrate how the generated images become more realistic over training iterations. The article explains the general mathematical framework behind generative models matching the distribution of the model to the true data distribution. It highlights two other types of generative models variational autoencoders (VAEs) and autoregressive models. It also summarizes several recent research contributions from OpenAI to improve GANs, VAEs, and reinforcement learning through better exploration using generative models. Overall, generative modeling is a rapidly advancing field that holds promise for learning useful representations of the world in an unsupervised manner."

The article discusses Ethereum, a new blockchainbased distributed computing platform that allows developers to build and deploy decentralized applications. Ethereum was created by Vitalik Buterin and officially released in July 2015. The Ethereum platform aims to improve upon Bitcoin by providing more advanced scripting capabilities. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum operates on a blockchain, meaning it is decentralized and transactions are cryptographically secured. However, Ethereum expands on Bitcoin's basic scripting language, allowing developers to write more complex smart contracts to encode business logic and build decentralized applications like digital currencies, voting systems, domain name registries, financial exchanges, crowdfunding platforms, etc. Ethereum could face similar technical challenges as Bitcoin, such as transaction delays and security vulnerabilities. There are also unresolved legal issues around blockchain technologies. Major banks have shown interest in Ethereum for streamlining trading and transfers. Michael Novogratz, formerly of Fortress Investment Group, has been exploring Ethereum's potential. Unlike Bitcoin's anonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto, Ethereum was created in a more transparent, open source manner by Vitalik Buterin along with a team of developers who continue to maintain the network and create Ethereumbased applications. While Bitcoin was the first application of blockchain technology, experts like Joseph Bonneau believe Ethereum is the first platform since Bitcoin to offer significant improvements in the blockchain space."

Many \\\"normal\\\" exceptions occur frequently but provide little value, creating noise that hides truly important exceptions. Examples include business logic errors like invalid user input, and system errors outside the application's control. Useful exceptions require code changes to prevent recurrence. Uncaught exceptions disrupt program flow, risk inconsistent state, and are difficult to track. Scala offers an alternative error handling approach without exceptions. Libraries that wrap lower level APIs often rethrow errors as generic exceptions, obscuring the original cause. Legacy Java apps likely suffer from high exception volume.

The dynamically typed PHP programming language enabled rapid development for Facebook but eventually struggled to handle the site's massive traffic growth. Facebook developed HipHop to convert PHP into C++, boosting server capacity 56x. But traffic kept growing, so they created HipHop Virtual Machine (HHVM) to JustInTime compile PHP into machine code for better hardware efficiency. HHVM became open source, and WordPress benchmarks show it significantly outperforms PHP. But PHP 7 brings major speed improvements, rivaling HHVM on WordPress and outpacing it on Drupal. PHP 7 features execution engine enhancements, reduced memory usage, and support for future asynchronous programming like HHVM. Benchmarks show PHP 7 performs basic tests faster than HHVM, but uses 4.5x more memory. Realworld tests on Wikimedia and Etsy demonstrate HHVM's ability to maximize hardware utilization and cut latency versus PHP 5.4. The takeaways: HHVM significantly outperforms PHP <7, but PHP 7 has a slight edge on WordPress. This may improve. Switching to HHVM is complex, taking Wikimedia and Etsy 6+ months. PHP 7 and HHVM both enable major speed improvements versus earlier PHP. Online businesses should evaluate PHP 7 and HHVM to optimize performance and efficiency."

It's time to transition civilian nuclear power to thorium. On September 12, 1932, physicist Leo Szilard conceived the idea of a nuclear chain reaction while waiting at a red light in London. This led to the development of atomic bombs in 1945. Scientists then realized they could harness nuclear power by slowing down the reaction. Many nuclear reactor designs were explored at Oak Ridge National Lab using either uranium or thorium as fuel. The government chose uranium because its byproduct plutonium could be used for bombs. This led to pressurized water reactors that require constant cooling circulation to prevent meltdown. The government prioritized small submarine reactors over safety. In contrast, thorium reactors run at normal pressure, stop safely if cooling fails, and produce less weaponsgrade waste. Their waste remains radioactive for only 300 years instead of tens of thousands. In the 1950s, nuclear power was aimed at military applications but civilian needs have changed. Thorium reactors now make more sense than pressurized water uranium reactors. They are safer, more abundant, and produce less hazardous waste. It is time to transition civilian nuclear power to thorium reactors by educating the public and policymakers."

The article discusses neural networks, which are a type of machine learning model. Neural networks are made up of simple nodes called neurons that are connected together. Each neuron takes a set of inputs, multiplies them by weights, and calculates an output. By connecting many neurons together, neural networks can model complex functions and find patterns in data. The article explains how neural networks can be used for prediction. A simple neural network can estimate the price of a house based on attributes like size and location. More complex neural networks with multiple layers of neurons can make better predictions by combining multiple simple models. Recurrent neural networks are introduced, which have memory and keep track of previous inputs. This allows them to find patterns over time and sequence data, like predicting the next letter when given all previous letters in a text sample. The article gives an example of using a recurrent neural network to generate new text in the style of Ernest Hemingway by training it on his novel The Sun Also Rises. Finally, the article shows how the same recurrent neural network algorithm can be used to generate new levels for Super Mario Bros by training it on data from original Super Mario Bros levels.

Deep learning has enabled major advances in computer vision and object recognition. Simple neural networks can be trained to recognize handwritten digits like the number 8, but have limitations when the image is not perfectly centered. More training data and deeper networks help, but the key innovation is convolution. Convolution works by passing small overlapping image tiles through a consistent neural network. The output is pooled to find the most activated parts of the image. Multiple convolution layers create a hierarchy to learn invariant features like edges, then simple shapes, then complex objects. With enough training data and a deep enough convolutional neural network, highly accurate image classifiers can be built. We demonstrate this by training a network with bird photos to obtain 95% accuracy at classifying images with birds. Precision and recall metrics provide better insight than overall accuracy alone. Our bird classifier has 97% precision and 90% recall. Convolutional neural networks are now the stateoftheart technique for image recognition."

It's unclear which will be better for complex deep learning models. Yesterday at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC), the company revealed its increased focus on artificial intelligence (AI). Apple mentioned its use of deep learning techniques like long shortterm memory (LSTM) in apps like Messages and its facial recognition in Photos. Apple claims it can do much of this AI computation ondevice without needing to develop extensive user profiles on servers. However, training deep learning models typically requires large datasets only feasible on servers. This highlights the difference between Apple's and Google's AI approaches. Google collects user data centrally to train models on its servers. As users generate more data, Google can refine its models. In contrast, Apple sends model parameters to user devices, allows ondevice computation to update the parameters with user data, and retrieves the updated parameters to improve its central model. For simple linear models, these approaches yield similar results, but for complex nonlinear models, the equivalence breaks down. The Apple method requires more clientside computation. The Google method needs minimal client capabilities beyond data collection. The balance of client versus server computation has swung back and forth over time. It's unclear which approach will prove superior for prediction and inference. But marketplace adoption may provide the ultimate test."

It allows browsers/CDNs to cache the content for up to a year without checking back with the server. The URL contains a version number or hash that changes when the content changes. 2. Server revalidation. This pattern is for mutable content whose URL cannot be versioned. The browser always checks back with the server before using cached content. The server can respond with 304 Not Modified if the content is unchanged. The article warns against using a small maxage on mutable content, as it can cause race conditions between interdependent resources like HTML, CSS, and JS getting out of sync in the cache. It explains how service workers can exacerbate these problems. It recommends using immutable content for most resources, and server revalidation for any mutable content that must have updatable URLs. maxage on mutable content should be used carefully only when dependencies are fully understood.

This represents a new wave in software that is not only displacing incumbent markets, but creating new ones termed Open Adoption Software (OAS) companies. OAS companies go through three phases Project, Product and Profit. By the Profit phase, they should resemble traditional enterprise software businesses financially. OAS is driven by customers Fortune 500 companies like Walmart, GE, Merck, Goldman Sachs and even the federal government are abandoning established vendors for open software's greater control and capability.

It can then predict interactions in new videos. Researchers at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory have developed an algorithm that can analyze video clips to learn about human interactions. The algorithm was trained on 600 hours of video from sitcoms like The Office and The Big Bang Theory to identify common interactions like handshakes, hugs, and kisses. It learned to recognize the moments leading up to those interactions. After training, the algorithm was able to predict what would happen next in a video clip it had not seen before with 43% accuracy, compared to 71% for humans. While not as accurate as humans yet, the researchers were impressed that the algorithm could make reasonable predictions after only basic training. The lead researcher, Carl Vondrick, says this selfsupervised learning approach could be useful for realworld applications like monitoring elderly patients to prevent falls or alerting emergency responders about dangerous situations. The algorithm does not truly understand the scenes like a human would, but is able to recognize patterns in the movement of pixels that correlate with certain interactions.

The article argues that current artificial intelligence systems reflect societal biases, which can lead to discrimination. It provides examples of how machine learning algorithms have exhibited racist, sexist, and classist biases, such as misclassifying images of minorities, showing highpaying job ads to men over women, and overpolicing poor neighborhoods. The root cause is that algorithms are often trained on biased data that does not represent diversity. This can perpetuate inequality if not addressed. The author argues we must be vigilant about how these systems are designed and trained. Inclusivity in the teams building them is important. Governments using predictive algorithms should also commit to fairness. Currently, debates about AI's existential threat are dominated by privileged white men. But for marginalized groups, the real threat of AI is that it could amplify existing biases if tech companies fail to prioritize inclusivity and accountability. We must address how current AI systems discriminate if we want to build fairer AI in the future."

Animation is becoming an essential part of interface design as it provides a new dimension of time to work with. It can make interfaces easier to understand, more pleasant to use, and nicer to look at. For example, animation can offload some of the mental processing of interface changes, explain relationships between elements, and teach users all without adding complexity. However, some animations that are technically well executed can actually make interfaces more confusing. This happens when animations contradict each other, like when tapping an app icon on the homescreen zooms into the app, but then zooming back out shows a stack of apps instead of the homescreen icons. Historically, graphical interfaces were static screens linked by hard cuts. Animation was limited by hardware capabilities. Now animation is common, but interfaces are still designed as separate screens linked crudely together later. This can lead to contradictory animations. Instead, interfaces should be thought of as collections of semantic components in a continuous space. Components enclose all related information and controls. Animations should reflect relationships between elements e.g. a popover emerging from a button it belongs to. Elements shouldn't have multiple visible representations. Animations should keep space consistent and not contradict earlier ones. While pure semantic animation isn't always practical, it improves interfaces by enforcing semantic thinking."

Angular CLI automates optimization. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) help build nativelike web apps using tools like Service Workers, IndexDB, and App Shell. Once the browser caches static assets, the app loads instantly on repeat visits. Angular's mobile toolkit helps developers build PWAs. However, Angular's large framework size is concerning for mobile apps. A simple Angular app can be 1.6MB, problematic on unreliable connections. During ngconf, the Angular team reduced a \\\"Hello World\\\" app to under 50K. This post explains the optimizations: 1. Minification and compression reduce unused code, whitespace, comments. This cut the bundle size from 1.6MB to 702K. Gzipping further reduced it to 156K. 2. Treeshaking with Rollup excludes unused exports, shrinking the bundle to 484K. Transpiling to ES5 and minifying got it down to 132K gzipped. 3. Angular's compiler (ngc) preprocesses templates to generate optimized code. This improved treeshaking, reducing the bundle to 49K gzipped. In summary, optimizations like treeshaking, minification, and compression can reduce an Angular bundle up to 33x. Tools like angularcli and angular2seed will automate this process. The goal is ~150K bundle sizes."

This week at the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition conference in Las Vegas, Google researchers presented several new computer vision accomplishments. First, they developed a system that can detect important people and events in videos. Using recurrent neural networks, it creates an \\\"attention mask\\\" to track the relevance of objects over time. This allows identifying not just the most important person, but other potentially important ones and associated events. It has applications for analyzing crowded footage. Second, they created a system for detecting the limbs of tigers and horses across videos as \\\"articulated object classes.\\\" By identifying independently moving parts, it can track legs and other limbs frame by frame even as the animal moves differently. While not critical itself, this enables detecting and tracking individual parts of people, animals, objects, etc. Third, they developed a method for computers to specify objects precisely using combinations of descriptors. For example, to identify a specific glass among many, it might say \\\"the short glass with a chip on the rim.\\\" This combines logic and image captioning systems. It allows accurately describing objects to humans and for humans to precisely specify objects to computers. All three projects use neural networks for computer vision, a common approach nowadays. But the specifics vary, so consult the papers for details."

In one study at a hightech company, practices from a successful U.S. innovation center were transferred to sites in India and China. However, the practices were interpreted and implemented differently across cultures. For example, shorter development cycles were seen as increasing efficiency in China versus enabling experimentation in the U.S. In a second study of software teams, management practices that worked in Germany and the U.S. created dissatisfaction when transferred to India. For example, Indian developers wanted more handson management and faster promotions compared to their U.S. and German counterparts. In an ongoing third study, the use of collaboration technologies differed across offices in Japan, Mexico, and the U.S. due to cultural factors.

He is cautiously optimistic about serverless architectures, which are a hot topic in software architecture. Serverless architectures allow running backend code without managing servers, similar to Backend as a Service (BaaS) and Functions as a Service (FaaS). Some examples of serverless architectures: For UIdriven applications like ecommerce, server logic can be replaced with third party authentication services, direct database access from the client, and serverless functions triggered by API gateways. This pushes logic like session tracking and page navigation to the client. For messagedriven applications like processing user activity, long running consumer applications can be replaced by serverless functions triggered by events like messages on a queue. The functions autoscale based on load. Key aspects of FaaS: No server provisioning or management needed. Provider handles scaling and availability. Functions can be triggered by events like file updates, scheduled tasks, and messages on a queue. Functions have restrictions around state, execution duration (e.g. max 5 minutes), and startup latency. Functions are typically used with an API Gateway to create HTTP triggered microservices. Drawbacks include immature tooling and challenges with debugging/monitoring. Open source platforms like OpenWhisk are emerging. Serverless does not mean no ops you still need monitoring, deployments, etc. And sys admins are still required somewhere. Serverless also does not equate to 'no code' you still write functions."

JavaScript is a popular programming language that can be easy to learn initially but difficult to master. Many resources assume you already have advanced knowledge. The author has used JavaScript since 1995 but moved away from clientside work until recently. Now browsers are more powerful and easier to debug. However, JavaScript has grown more complex so it's still not easy to master. The author suggests you don't need to master JavaScript to be a good developer. This article shares practical tips on organizing code, linting, testing, and using browser developer tools. These can help you write better code even if you're new to JavaScript. The article advises avoiding putting lots of JavaScript directly in HTML files. Instead use separate JS files. For organization, avoid jumping right to frameworks. The module pattern provides a simple way to package code into modules with explicit interfaces. An example shows refactoring some form validation code into a module. Linting checks code for issues beyond syntax errors. Modern editors provide realtime linting feedback as you code. An example demonstrates improving some code by running it through JSHint. Testing is also important but the author admits to not doing it enough. Editors can stub out tests automatically to reduce grunt work. An example shows adding a test to an existing function using the Jasmine framework. Finally, browser developer tools are essential for debugging issues.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) was launched 10 years ago as a side business for Amazon.com. It has grown into the most successful cloud infrastructure company, with over 30% market share more than Microsoft, IBM, and Google combined. The origins of AWS trace back to 2000, when Amazon was struggling with scale and had created a jumbled technology infrastructure. In 2000, Amazon began documenting APIs to support an ecommerce platform called Merchant.com. This forced Amazon to start developing in a more organized, serviceoriented way. Around 2003, Amazon realized its internal infrastructure services like compute, storage, and databases could be valuable to external developers. At an executive retreat, Amazon identified these infrastructure services as a core competency, though it took time to fully realize the potential. By 2003, Amazon started thinking of these services as an \\\"operating system\\\" for the internet. AWS was launched in 2006 with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. It took competitors several years to respond. AWS now dominates infrastructure services, though companies like Microsoft and Google are competing. AWS's success was not initially predicted. But Amazon laid the groundwork by solving internal infrastructure problems, then realizing these services could benefit external developers. AWS pioneered the cloud infrastructure market and transformed how companies build and deploy applications."

The deal would give Estácio shareholders 1.281 Kroton shares plus 170 million reais in extraordinary dividends for each Estácio share. The transaction still needs final approval from both companies and regulators. The acquisition would make Kroton the undisputed leader in Brazilian education with around 1.5 million students if approved. Analysts say Cade is likely to require the combined company to divest some distance learning assets to approve the deal. Kroton would gain scale and eliminate duplicate structures through the acquisition. The education market is consolidating amid Brazil's economic crisis. Kroton is seen as overcapitalized, so the acquisition provides a way to invest its cash. The deal could spur other M&A in the sector.

Elon Musk has also said he thinks the odds are billions to one that we are not living in \\\"base reality\\\". Recently, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson said the belief that we could be in a simulation is a \\\"logical possibility\\\". He argued that if we are in a simulation, the laws of nature that we observe may just be part of the simulation code rather than real natural laws. Some academics are skeptical of the simulation theory. Oxford professor Peter Millican thinks the theory wrongly assumes that superintelligent beings outside the simulation would think in similar ways to humans inside it. However, he says researching such unconventional ideas can lead to new insights and should not be dismissed out of hand. The simulation theory has parallels with ideas from philosophers like Descartes and Berkeley from centuries ago. Even if the theory turns out to be false, thinking about such possibilities outside the norm could lead to new discoveries."

Companies like Microsoft, Facebook, Apple, Google, WeChat, and Slack are investing heavily in chatbots. Startups are building chatbot apps, platforms, and libraries. There are two main approaches to building chatbots: retrievalbased models and generative models. Retrievalbased models select responses from a fixed set using rules and ML classifiers. They don't make grammatical mistakes but are limited. Generative models generate new responses from scratch using seq2seq models. They are more flexible but prone to errors. Chatbots for short, closed domain conversations are easier to build than chatbots for long, open domain dialog. Evaluation is challenging standard NLP metrics like BLEU don't correlate well with human judgment. Key challenges include: incorporating conversational context, maintaining a consistent personality, promoting response diversity, and handling users' intentions. Despite recent progress, chatbots still work poorly for open domain conversations. They work reasonably well for narrow domains given enough data. Upcoming research is focused on: hierarchical models, attention mechanisms, evaluation metrics, diversity, and modeling personality and intention.

SQL is preferable for most apps, using NoSQL where needed. Polyglot persistence combines both. The concept of NoSQL databases has been around for a while, but there are still some misunderstandings about NoSQL vs relational SQL databases. NoSQL refers to 4 types of databases document, column, keyvalue, and graph. NoSQL databases are often considered \\\"schemaless\\\", but this isn't entirely true. The schema is implicit rather than explicit. Developers still need to maintain the schema, just in code rather than database constraints. This makes the schema less rigorous. Schema migrations are also not inherently easier in NoSQL. You still have to change code to handle different versions, and migrate old data to new formats. SQL databases handle this transparently through migration scripts. SQL databases provide data integrity through constraints, ensuring consistency. NoSQL shifts this responsibility to the application code. SQL also supports atomic crosstable transactions, while NoSQL atomicity is typically limited to single documents. The main benefits of NoSQL are scalability and performance. SQL doesn't scale as easily across multiple servers. NoSQL databases are best for systems expecting massive scalability needs. For most applications, SQL is preferable for its outofthebox capabilities like schema rigidity and integrity checks. Polyglot persistence combines SQL and NoSQL, using NoSQL only where needed.

Neoliberalism promotes free market capitalism, privatization, deregulation, lower taxes, and reduced government spending. It gained influence in the 1970s under leaders like Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. Neoliberal policies have led to slower economic growth, rising inequality, financial crises, and a loss of power for the poor and middle class as the rich gain more control over wealth and politics. Neoliberalism operates in an anonymous way, often not using the term itself. This allows its ideas to spread while avoiding criticism. The article traces the history of neoliberalism back to thinkers like Hayek and Friedman in the 1940s50s. It was originally a fringe ideology but was aggressively promoted by a network of think tanks and activists funded by wealthy supporters. It went mainstream in the 1970s80s and became dominant through figures like Thatcher and Reagan. The article argues the left has failed to produce an alternative to neoliberalism. Keynesian policies are insufficient today. The article calls for developing a new \\\"Apollo Program\\\" for the economy to create an alternative adapted for the 21st century. It sees neoliberalism as a failed god but still influential zombie ideology that must be opposed."

At New Haircut, we've found that 5 day design sprints work best for most companies. Trying to shorten the sprint often backfires team members miss key discussions and momentum is lost. Everyone should fully commit to the 5 days. It's common for the initial sprint prototype to not get the desired reaction from customers. This is normal. Run a second sprint, which can move faster by skipping day 1. Sprints help validate you're solving the right problems before too much time is invested. Completely clearing calendars is essential so the team can fully focus for 5 days without distractions. Allow checking email for 1 hour each morning if needed. Talk to customers before the sprint to gather data to bring into day 1. Have at least 5 customers lined up for prototype testing. You need people in the core sprint roles but don't necessarily need 7 people. Consider bringing in an outside expert if you lack skills like design. But try to avoid individual contractors, a small outside team is better for team chemistry. Even if it's just a prototype, include a designer. Design has a big impact and companies often realize this after seeing it in action during a sprint. Get creative if customer recruitment is challenging. Offer gift cards for their time if needed. But you only need 5+ customers. If your team is hesitant, explain how 5 days is a small investment to validate you're on the right track. Fear of uncertainty often drives resistance."

The article discusses a legal dispute over the authenticity of a painting attributed to renowned artist Peter Doig. The painting, depicting a desert landscape, is signed \\\"Pete Doige 76\\\" and owned by Robert Fletcher. Fletcher claims he met a young Peter Doig in the 1970s when Doig was incarcerated in Thunder Bay, Canada. Fletcher says he helped Doig find work after his release, and Doig painted the desert landscape as a gift. Years later, the painting was identified as potentially being by famous artist Peter Doig. Doig adamantly denies painting it or ever being in Thunder Bay. He says he would have been only 16 in 1976 and living in Toronto. Doig claims the real artist was a man named Peter Doige who attended Lakehead University and served time in Thunder Bay. Doige's sister corroborates this claim. Fletcher and art dealer Peter Bartlow, who believe the painting is an early Doig work, have sued Doig to authenticate it. Judge Gary Feinerman ruled the case should go to trial, as the evidence is inconclusive. Doig plans to present records showing he was not in Thunder Bay when the painting was created. The case centers on authorship and threatens to undermine Doig's control over his artistic output if he loses. Even if Fletcher wins, the painting may have little value if Doig insists it is not his work. The case underscores the challenges of authenticating art."

Empathy builds trust through honest connection. The video is a wellmade animation that illustrates a key part of Dr. Brené Brown's lecture on empathy versus sympathy. It clearly explains the difference between an empathetic response, where you try to understand how someone feels, versus a sympathetic response, where you express condolences in a culturally acceptable way. Empathy requires active listening without judgment, honesty about your feelings, and making a human connection. This builds trust and is ultimately more helpful than sympathy. Sympathy can sometimes involve pointing out silver linings in a way that is not actually useful to the person. The video argues that taking the more difficult empathetic approach, fully acknowledging someone's pain, can help both people feel better. Identifying similar feelings in similar situations strengthens bonds and communities. The message is that we should try to listen and relate when someone opens up, rather than rushing to solutions. If we share each other's burdens through empathy, we can help each other through hard times."

Researchers from Microsoft and the University of Washington have achieved a milestone in DNA data storage by successfully storing 200 megabytes of data on synthetic DNA strands. The data was encoded onto the DNA strands and then later decoded back into digital data. The amount of data fit into a space much smaller than the tip of a pencil, demonstrating the potential for highly compact DNA data storage. The stored data included digital artwork, books, databases, and more. Demand for data storage is growing exponentially but existing storage media capacity is not keeping up, so DNA's potential is promising. Advantages of DNA storage include its durability, compactness, and perpetual relevance. The MicrosoftUW team is one of several researching DNA storage globally. While they acknowledge challenges to making the technology practical, they have already increased capacity 1000x in the past year. Their diverse team of computer scientists and molecular biologists aims to apply insights from both fields to make advances. The process works by translating digital binary data into DNA's four nucleotide bases. The DNA strands are synthesized, stored in a test tube, and later amplified via PCR techniques to recover the data. The DNA sequence is decoded back into digital data. While still early, the team is optimistic about DNA's potential for massively compact archival data storage."

The software code for the Apollo 11 space program was written in assembly language by programmers at MIT in the 1960s. Margaret Hamilton, director of software engineering, stands next to a stack of paper containing the code she helped write. In 2003, tech researcher Ron Burkey transcribed the code from scanned images and made it available online. Last week, former NASA intern Chris Garry uploaded the code to GitHub. Programmers are now analyzing the code, especially the comments written in plain English. The comments contain lighthearted jokes and 1960s pop culture references. For example, one file is called BURN_BABY_BURN and another contains a Shakespeare quote. The silly comments show the playfulness of the original programmers. Now on GitHub, developers can suggest changes and file issues with the decadesold code. Some have jokingly filed bug reports, while others have left witty responses. The uploading of the code has made this historical software more accessible for people to study and admire."

Retailers are starting to adopt tech like smart mirrors. The article discusses research by the Brazilian Association of Shopping Centers (Abrasce) on shopping trends in Brazil. It found that Brazilians are spending more time and money at shopping malls compared to 2012. The average visit time increased from 73 to 76 minutes, while the average ticket price rose from around $197 to $244 (in inflationadjusted values). The main reasons cited for increased mall visits and spending are the economic crisis and the rising dollar. With more expensive foreign travel, upper class Brazilians are shopping domestically and spending more than lower classes. Shopping remains the top reason to visit malls, cited by 45%, down slightly from 47% in 2012. Around 59% made a purchase on their last visit, up from 48% in 2012. Younger and single visitors are going to malls more often. Teenagers under 19 now comprise 18% of visitors, up from 10% in 2012. Singles represent 63% of visitors versus 49% in 2012.

The original PlayStation console launched in the 1990s revolutionized gaming by introducing 3D graphics, despite initial reluctance from some in the industry. It sold over 100 million units and blew away the competition from Nintendo and Sega. Virtual reality (VR) is an emerging technology today like 3D gaming was back then. Though some remain skeptical about widespread VR adoption, it can drive the adoption of other technologies, just as PlayStation drove upgrades to 3Dcapable consoles. VR capabilities can incentivize consumers to upgrade their smartphones to fully utilize VR, which Google needs as Android upgrade rates have been low. VR could even drive adoption of advanced features like 4K displays. VR can also drive consumers to choose Android over iPhone, as Apple's VR plans remain uncertain. However, companies can't assume consumers will automatically upgrade for VR it needs to cross over from early tech enthusiasts to the mainstream. Concrete consumer use cases are key, as are additional innovators beyond Facebook and Google. Enterprise VR is an important emerging vertical, with companies like Meta already serving many clients. Investors see VR as enhancing solutions in existing sectors, so enterprise use cases may drive more investment. Just as independent game developers propelled PlayStation's success, third parties will find niche VR applications in many industries.

The article discusses time perception and how it differs from objective time. It explains the concepts of psychological time, active and passive phases of an event, start/end event markers, and techniques like preemptive start and early completion that can alter a user's perception of time. The key points are: Objective time can be measured, but psychological time is how users perceive the duration of events. Events have active phases where the user is engaged, and passive phases where they have no control. Passive phases feel longer than active ones of the same duration. Preemptive start shifts the perceived start of an event later by starting with an active phase. Early completion shifts the perceived end of an event earlier by quickly moving from passive to active. These techniques exploit psychology to make experiences feel faster to users."

Speed should match user expectations. When technical performance optimizations reach certain limits, psychology and perception management might help us push the limits further. Waiting can consist of active and passive phases; to make a wait feel shorter, we increase the active phase and reduce the passive phase. But what if an event is a purely passive wait? Can we push the limits further? Studies identify 14 distinct types of waiting situations on the web. David Maister conceptualized 8 \\\"propositions\\\" about the psychology of waiting that experiments have confirmed. For example, occupied time feels shorter than unoccupied time. To manage users' tolerance for waiting, we can use progress indicators. Dynamic indicators updating information over time are best for longer waits. Static, unchanging indicators can work for shorter waits. Beyond progress indicators, services can engage users during waits with forms to fill out or characters to view. But some go too far, adding uncertainty that makes waits feel longer. Though faster is often better, speed should match user expectations. Users expect banks to be slower, so a placebo progress bar builds perceived value. The goal is not just speed, but speed that meets user needs."

Steps include moving to HTTPS, splitting assets, and limiting domain sharding. The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the protocol that governs communication between web servers and browsers. HTTP/1.1, the current version, was defined in 1999. Modern websites now require loading much more data than in 1999 around 1.9 MB on average for a homepage. HTTP/1.1 does not perform well with these large page loads. In 2009, Google engineers created SPDY, which aimed to improve HTTP performance by allowing concurrent requests over one connection (multiplexing), prioritizing assets, compressing headers, and pushing vital resources from server to browser (server push). SPDY requires encryption and browser/server support. It gained adoption but is now being replaced by HTTP/2. HTTP/2 is backwards compatible so requires no changes for users. However, many best practices for HTTP/1.1 become detrimental under HTTP/2. As more servers and browsers add HTTP/2 support, sites not optimized for it will seem slower. To optimize for HTTP/2: Move to HTTPS if not already Use individual image files rather than sprites where beneficial Avoid inlining images in CSS Split CSS and JavaScript files into pagespecific assets rather than concatenating Remove domain sharding To prepare for HTTP/2: Create individual assets alongside sprites/inlined images Organize assets by page section despite concatenating Limit sharding to two domains The tipping point to optimize for HTTP/2 is when most visitors use supporting browsers. Check analytics and browser support data to determine this. Speak to hosting providers about HTTP/2 server support. Once ready, stop using old practices and optimize for HTTP/2."

Pivotal is a $2.8 billion enterprise software company backed by Ford, Microsoft, and GE. The company brings in catered breakfast every day for employees as an incentive to attend the daily allhands meeting at 9:06 AM. These meetings last 510 minutes just long enough to introduce new employees, make announcements, and break the huddle. After that, employees have no more meetings for the rest of the day and can focus on their work. Pivotal CEO Rob Mee calls this \\\"sustainable software development\\\". By removing meetings and other distractions, employees can stay productive for about 38 of their 40 hour work weeks. This avoids employee burnout and leads to better products, according to Mee. Employees also leave by 6 PM every day for a healthy worklife balance. Other perks at Pivotal include unlimited drinks, onsite haircuts, and \\\"Interrupt\\\" duty taking turns wearing headphones to avoid constant distractions. The goal is to remove all barriers to productivity so employees can get their work done during normal hours. Some companies try to copy the aesthetics of Pivotal's offices without implementing the management philosophy, which Mee says is crucial for success."

It provides an example Redis container with TLS support using Honcho. A common misconception is that Docker is only for singleprocess containers. However, Docker allows for multiprocess containers using tools like Supervisor. The author does not recommend using Supervisor because it can mask failures if a process fails, the container keeps running even though the service is down. The author recommends using Honcho instead to manage processes defined in a Procfile. With Honcho, if any process fails the whole container exits properly. The article walks through creating a custom Redis container with TLS support using Honcho. It installs stunnel and Honcho in a Dockerfile. It configures stunnel and creates a Procfile to define processes. When the container runs, Honcho launches the stunnel and Redis processes. If either fails, the container exits. This allows creating a Redis container with TLS support in a single container. The author provides the Dockerfile and configs on GitHub to build the image yourself.

The Android operating system uses verified boot to detect changes to the system through cryptographic integrity checking. Starting in Android 7.0, verified boot is strictly enforcing, meaning devices with corrupt boot images won't boot fully without user consent. This strict checking makes nonmalicious data corruption more impactful since detected corruption in the verified dmverity partitions results in entire 4KiB blocks becoming inaccessible. To improve dmverity robustness, forward error correction (FEC) was introduced. This allows detecting and correcting errors in data by shipping redundant encoding data generated with an errorcorrecting ReedSolomon code. A technique called interleaving was used to map each byte to a separate code across blocks, allowing recovery from consecutive block corruption with low overhead. For a 2GiB partition, the new dmverity error correction allows recovery from up to 16MiB of consecutive corrupted blocks with only 0.8% space overhead. This improves security through strict verified boot while also increasing reliability against data corruption events. There is no performance impact unless corruption is detected. The improvements are available in Android 7.0."

American crows have been observed calling to each other, gathering around, and paying special attention to a dead crow. This behavior may appear like the crows are mourning their dead, but researcher Kaeli Swift believes the crows are likely trying to assess if there is a threat where the death occurred so they can avoid danger in the future. In an experiment, Swift had masked human volunteers stand near crow food sources while holding a dead crow, standing near a dead hawk, or standing near a dead hawk holding a dead crow. The crows scolded the volunteers and were wary of the area for several days afterwards, suggesting they saw the humans as threatening. The hawkanddeadcrow combination provoked the strongest reaction. In a separate experiment, crows had a milder response to volunteers holding dead pigeons, indicating they are more sensitive to dead crows specifically. According to Swift's advisor John Marzluff, crows have excellent memories and can recognize individual human faces for over nine years. This helps them respond appropriately to humans, some of whom may threaten crows while others feed them. Overall, the research demonstrates crows pay close attention to cues that a person may be dangerous."

Proper architecture and tools could have supported the growth for less. Jonathan Zarra built the Pokémon GO chat app GoChat which reached 1 million users in 5 days. However, he struggled to pay for the servers to host that many users and had to shut the app down. Zarra hired a contractor who said the server costs were around $4000 per month. However, with proper architecture an app like this could run on much cheaper servers. I built a similar Pokémon GO app called GoSnaps which reached 500,000 users in 5 days. GoSnaps runs on a $100 per month Google Cloud server. Both apps make heavy database queries to fetch data based on location. But GoSnaps prepares data in separate collections to allow simpler queries. This small change makes a big difference in performance. When building an MVP, some developers focus only on getting a functional product out quickly. But a little time on scalability up front is worth it. Choosing fast languages like NodeJS helps. Separating data logically avoids complex queries. With the right tools and design, an MVP can be built quickly while still planning for growth. If your app could get a lot of users fast, build in scalability from the start."

Large datasets and compute power enable companies to train highly accurate CNN models. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a type of artificial neural network that have been highly influential in the field of computer vision. CNNs were first popularized in 2012 when Alex Krizhevsky used them to win that year's ImageNet competition. Since then, companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Instagram have used CNNs for image classification in their services. The goal of image classification is to take an input image and output a predicted class label that describes the image, such as \\\"cat\\\", \\\"dog\\\", etc. The input to a CNN is an array of pixel values. The CNN contains convolutional layers that each apply a set of filters to the input to identify lowlevel features like edges and curves. As the image passes through more convolutional layers, higherlevel features are identified. Finally, a fully connected layer looks at the highlevel features and predicts class probabilities based on which features are most correlated with each class. CNNs require training on labeled image datasets to learn the proper weights for each filter in identifying features. The backpropagation algorithm is used to calculate the contribution of each filter to the overall loss, and the weights are updated to reduce the loss. With enough training iterations on sufficient data, the CNN can become welltuned for image classification tasks. Companies that have large datasets have an advantage in training more effective CNNs."

The article discusses different types of tests on Android unit tests, integration tests, functional tests, and acceptance tests. Unit tests focus on testing small units of functionality in isolation. They are fast, reliable, and easy to debug, but may not catch issues when units are combined. Integration tests focus on combining code units and testing if they work together correctly. They find bugs unit tests miss, but are less reliable and harder to diagnose. Functional tests verify a feature works as specified by comparing inputs and outputs. They don't care about implementation details. Acceptance tests run tests through the full system to ensure it satisfies specifications from a user perspective. They guarantee functionality works for users, but are slower and harder to debug. The article recommends focusing more on acceptance tests than unit tests for mobile apps. Unit tests require lots of mocks and may not catch real world usage issues. Acceptance tests using Espresso guarantee functionality works as expected on real devices, despite being slower. Ideally, apps should have few business rules (test those with unit tests) and focus more on testing use cases to ensure a smooth user experience (with acceptance tests)."

Pokémon Go, a new mobile version of the popular video game franchise Pokémon, has become a global phenomenon since launching in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand in July 2016. The augmented reality game allows players to catch Pokémon characters that appear on their phone screens in realworld locations. Within days of launch, Pokémon Go had over 20 million daily active users in the U.S. alone and became one of the most profitable mobile games ever, generating over $14 million in revenue. The game encourages players to explore cities to find and catch Pokémon. This has led to safety concerns, as some players have been robbed or found dead bodies while focused on the game. Museums and other institutions have also asked to be removed from the game due to inappropriate gameplay locations. In response to safety concerns, Portuguese insurance company Tranquilidade announced a new personal accident insurance product called \\\"AP GO\\\" that covers injuries suffered while playing Pokémon Go.

The full code is available on GitHub. The article describes an Android library for centering faces in images. It is built on top of the Google Vision API's face detection capabilities. The author first uses the face detection API to locate faces in an image. The API can detect faces and facial landmarks. With the face position data, the author chooses one face and calculates where to crop the image to center that face. If no face is detected, it falls back to center cropping the image. The cropped bitmap is then scaled to fit the target ImageView. The face position is recalculated on the scaled image to keep it centered. The full code is available in the author's GitHub repositories. The library allows easy integration with Picasso for loading images. A version for Fresco is also planned. Some example images show the face centering results. The library has been published for use in other apps. The author welcomes contributions on GitHub to improve the project."

Her new book explores the importance of warmth and confidence. Harvard Business School professor Amy Cuddy has studied first impressions for over 15 years. She says people quickly evaluate two things when they first meet you: Can I trust this person? Can I respect this person? These relate to friendliness and competence. Surprisingly, Cuddy says friendliness is more important. People first want to know if you are trustworthy before deciding if you are competent. This makes evolutionary sense it was critical for survival to know if someone was a friend or foe. Cuddy's new book explores confidence. She says competence is only evaluated after trust is established. Focusing too much on proving strength can backfire. MBA students often emphasize competence and seem unapproachable. Cuddy says a warm, trustworthy person who is also strong elicits admiration. But people must trust you first before your strength becomes a gift and not a threat. Overachievers can get frustrated when they don't get job offers because no one trusted them. Cuddy gave an interesting TED Talk on power poses and increasing confidence.

While the sculpture places focus on adapting the human body, some argue the real issue is society's obsession with cars, not human biology. New technologies like cars have evolved much faster than human bodies. Creations like Graham spark discussion about road safety, but also raise questions around how human bodies can or should adapt to modern technology."

The 7th Specialized Panel of the Federal Regional Court of the 2nd Region (TRF2) unanimously upheld the validity of Resolution 1/99, established by the Federal Council of Psychology (CFP) in Brazil. The resolution prohibits psychologists from carrying out practices aimed at \\\"curing\\\" homosexuality or pathologizing homosexual behaviors. This ruling rejects an appeal filed by the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office of Rio de Janeiro (MPFRJ), which sought to annul the CFP resolution. The TRF2 decision can still be appealed to higher courts. Lawyer Chyntia Barcellos says the CFP regulations prohibit psychologists from trying to reverse homosexuality, which is not considered a disease. The TRF2 panel stated the CFP has authority to regulate the psychology profession, and \\\"promoting treatment and cures for homosexuality contributes to the pathologization of sexual orientation.\\\" The ruling reaffirms the illegality of legislative proposals to regulate \\\"treatment\\\" or \\\"cures\\\" for homosexuality in Brazil."

It is growing globally. Christopher Johnson McCandless graduated from university in 1990, changed his name, donated his savings, abandoned his possessions, and embarked on an adventure living on the fringes of consumer society. In August 1994, he was found dead in an abandoned bus in Alaska after a tragic struggle against the consumerist society. Journalist Jon Krakauer told McCandless's story in the book Into the Wild, later adapted into a film. McCandless represents an extreme version of voluntary simplicity, which involves rejecting consumerism and materialism. This philosophy is growing, especially among youth who see that happiness doesn't require endless consumption. Voluntary simplicity means detachment, like Heloisa de Paula, who slowly reduced her possessions after returning from the U.S. She now lives minimally but happily in a small apartment without a car or television. Thinkers like Thoreau and Fromm have advocated similar lifestyles. In the 1960s, hippies embodied a philosophy based on peace and love rather than possessions, though they didn't last long. Today's voluntary simplifiers work and have homes but prefer smaller living spaces and fewer possessions. Some use public transit or car sharing instead of owning cars. In Brazil the movement is growing slowly as people like Maria da Conceição Vieira opt for bicycles over cars, smaller homes, and value relationships over possessions. Voluntary simplicity requires reflecting on needs versus desires, living intentionally, valuing relationships over things, and controlling one's actions. It is a personal path requiring daily effort to find balance."

Researchers at Google trained a neural network on a large corpus of news articles to learn word embeddings that capture semantic relationships between words. The resulting Word2vec embeddings exhibit gender bias, reflecting stereotypes in the original corpus. For example, \\\"man\\\" is closer to \\\"computer programmer\\\" while \\\"woman\\\" is closer to \\\"homemaker\\\". To address this, researchers developed a method called \\\"hard debiasing\\\" to mathematically transform the vector space to reduce gender bias. They identified genderbiased word pairs using crowdsourcing, then altered the vector space geometry to reduce associations between gendered words. After transforming the vector space, gender analogies like \\\"she:he::midwife:doctor\\\" become less biased analogies like \\\"she:he::hen:cock\\\". The researchers empirically evaluated their method, showing it significantly reduces direct and indirect gender bias while preserving utility of the embeddings. The goal is to prevent machine learning systems from amplifying societal biases. While word embeddings reflect realworld biases, reducing bias in computer systems could contribute to reducing gender bias in society. At minimum, machine learning should not amplify harmful biases."

It provides functionality of RelativeLayout, LinearLayout, and more in a single container. ConstraintLayout and the layout editor tools are currently in preview. The information in this post is based on constraintlayout:1.0.0alpha4. These behaviors may change as the tools approach final release. ConstraintLayout is a new layout container introduced at Google I/O 2016. It is designed to improve the Android layout experience and works with a new constraintbased visual editor in Android Studio. Constraints connect anchor points on views to targets like sibling views, the parent container, or guidelines. Constraints align views and control their positioning and sizing. Biasing allows uneven distribution of space between two constraints on the same axis. This gives functionality similar to weights in LinearLayout. Guidelines are special views that create anchor points for constraints. They are invisible at runtime but provide arbitrary alignment guides. Views can be measured with exact, wrap content, or \\\"any size\\\" modes. Any size stretches a dimension to fill the constraints, replacing match_parent. Aspect ratio constraints maintain a specific width/height ratio on views for tasks like images. ConstraintLayout flattens view hierarchies and provides functionality of RelativeLayout, LinearLayout, and more in a single container."
1469726572,6797033574746412211,"en","tech","How ConstraintLayout uses linear equation solving for flexible Android layouts ConstraintLayout converts layout constraints into linear equations, solves them to determine view bounds, and sets positions accordingly. This allows complex responsive UIs without nesting layouts. The article explains how ConstraintLayout and its layout editor tools work internally. ConstraintLayout uses a LayoutParams object to store layout attributes for each child view. LayoutParams contains a ConstraintWidget object which holds information about the view's position and size computed from the constraints. During measurement, ConstraintLayout does an initial pass to get view sizes without constraints. Any \\\"any size\\\" views are remeasured after constraints are applied to get their actual size. Match parent doesn't work well because view content placement relies on measurement, not final layout position. For layout, a ConstraintWidgetContainer computes view bounds by analyzing the overall constraint system as linear equations. It uses the Cassowary algorithm to solve the system of equations and determine each view's bounds. Then ConstraintLayout iterates over child views and sets their bounds. The article gives an example of how horizontal and vertical centering constraints on a button inside a parent produce 16 constraint equations. There are equations for the parent bounds, positioning constraints for the button's left/right edges, centering constraints to keep equal spacing, and positioning constraints for the button's top/bottom edges. Solving these computes the button's bounds. In summary, ConstraintLayout converts constraints to linear equations, solves them to determine view bounds, and sets view positions accordingly. This complex process allows flexible layouts without nesting view groups."

His ability to make improbable deductions has made him an unforgettable and globally referenced detective. Mind maps can help anyone think more like Holmes by organizing thoughts and concepts visually around a central idea. They work by placing a main topic in the center, then branching out related ideas, words, and references like a spider web. Mind maps are useful for analyzing problems, memorizing information, brainstorming, taking notes, and decision making. Though used by Holmes, mind maps were popularized in the 1970s by Tony Buzan to improve cognition. They utilize radial thinking, linking concepts together based on associations. This allows the brain to extract more connections. Mind maps clarify thoughts, assist strategic planning, and provide a big picture view of complex ideas.

Assuming engineers are smarter than business people and can predict all requirements. Requirements always expand so avoid overgeneralizing code. 2. Trying to create reusable business logic. Requirements diverge so isolate functionality vertically instead of horizontal abstraction. 3. Making everything generic. Solve the actual problem rather than finding perfect abstractions. 4.

Industrial business models leveraged machines for increasing returns to scale, while digital models utilize network effects for accelerating returns. Shifting from an incremental to exponential mindset is key across the business journey having an ambitious vision and comfort with uncertainty in the launch phase, courage and patience to see results in the build phase, and agility through empowerment in the growth phase. The exponential path is slower at first but accelerates rapidly. The expectation gap, where progress seems lacking compared to linear gains, poses the greatest risk that leaders will abandon the exponential path.

Preparation through education is key to adapting to the changes. The article discusses how advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning are enabling automation of an increasing number of jobs, including whitecollar office jobs that involve routine cognitive tasks. Some studies estimate that nearly half of jobs in the U.S. and other developed countries are at high risk of automation in the coming decades. The key factor is not whether a job is manual or whitecollar, but whether it involves routine and repetitive tasks versus creativity and social skills. Economists warn about \\\"job polarization\\\" where middleskill routine jobs disappear while lowskill and highskill nonroutine jobs expand. However, experts say automation also tends to create new jobs and industries, just as it has done in the past during other waves of technological change. By reducing costs and boosting demand, automation redefines jobs and changes the skills required rather than simply eliminating jobs. Historical examples are given of automation in weaving and bank tellers. Rather than reducing employment, computers have changed the nature of work and skills needed. New jobs also arise to build, maintain and update the new systems. While some jobs may be fully automated, many will continue requiring human skills like empathy and social interaction. There are differing views on whether this time is different due to the broad scope of automation, but preparation through retraining and education is widely agreed to be essential."

The article describes how to demonstrate autoscaling using Kubernetes by deploying a PHP application and exposing it as a service. A Horizontal Pod Autoscaler is configured to maintain a target CPU utilization of 50% across the PHP pods by increasing/decreasing the number of pod replicas. Initially, the PHP deployment has 2 pods running on 2 nodes. When load is applied by sending continuous requests to the PHP service, the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler scales the deployment to 7 pods. However, some pods become pending due to insufficient CPU resources. This triggers the Cluster Autoscaler to add a new node to the cluster, allowing all 7 pods to run. Once load is stopped, CPU utilization drops to 0 and the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler decreases the number of PHP pod replicas back down to 1. After a delay to avoid prematurely removing nodes, the Cluster Autoscaler deletes the unneeded node that was previously added. The example demonstrates how Horizontal Pod Autoscaler and Cluster Autoscaler can work together to dynamically scale both the number of pods and nodes to match application load. This allows efficient use of resources, only paying for compute power when it is truly needed."

But Nubank has a head start in the digital finance space. Elopar, a group owned by Bradesco and Banco do Brasil, has launched Digio, a digital credit card competitor to Nubank. Nubank is considered a fintech success story in Brazil, with around 1 million credit cards issued and a long waitlist. It proved that a fully digital business model could disrupt traditional banks. Digio aims to follow Nubank's footsteps, with the backing of Visa as opposed to Nubank's Mastercard partnership. Unlike Nubank, Digio does not require an invitation to sign up users. The registration and expense management is handled through a mobile app with no annual fees. As a division of Elopar's CBSS bank, Digio has strong financial backing but still has a long way to catch up to Nubank's established user base. The Brazilian fintech space already has competition from startups like ContaUm and Neon. It remains to be seen if Digio can gain significant market share. But the launch of Digio indicates traditional banks are trying to adapt to the digital financial model that fintechs have proven successful."

WalMart Stores Inc. is in talks to acquire Jet.com, an online retailer founded last year by Marc Lore. Jet.com has differentiated itself through a realtime savings engine that reduces prices as customers add items to their carts. This allows Jet.com to optimize logistics and shipping costs. In its first year, Jet.com reached over $1 billion in gross merchandise value and 4 million customers. The average order value is over $80. However, Jet.com is still investing heavily in marketing and has not reached profitability. Even at Jet.com's goal of $20 billion in gross merchandise value by 2020, it would only account for 4% of the US ecommerce market. Therefore, Walmart is likely more interested in Jet.com's logistics expertise and ability to offer fast delivery. Acquiring Jet.com would help Walmart better compete with Amazon and eBay. Jet.com has expertise in areas Walmart needs to improve like grocery delivery. Both companies are expanding their marketplace models. It will be interesting to see if other bidders emerge for Jet.com, as happened when Amazon acquired Jet.com founder Marc Lore's previous company Quidsi instead of Walmart."

This simplifies changing business processes since you just update the microservice. The article discusses how monolithic applications can be renewed using SOA (serviceoriented architecture) with microservices. It explains that before services were created, monolithic applications provided all business processes like ERPs. These contain large amounts of processes, information, and applications, leading to redundancy. SOA introduced a service layer above information and applications, defining standards for connecting monolithics and standardizing information so business processes can compose services without replication. This eliminates redundancy and provides an organized value chain. Microservices emerged to further avoid redundancy. Rather than having applications below the service layer, microservices become the owners of information and applications just consume APIs. This removes overlapping processes and implementations. Each microservice owns a context of information. The article recommends moving to an eventdriven architecture with microservices owning information. This avoids redundancy and differences in processes across applications. It makes changing business processes and information easier since you just update the microservice, not various applications."

Modern software engineering focuses on scalability, fast product delivery, and crossplatform abilities. Since the internet boom, smartphones, and the postpc era, software development has shifted from centralized, monolithic systems to multiplatform applications that can quickly adapt to changing market needs. Microservices have become the new architectural standard, enabling independent development, deployment, and scaling. However, microservices also create new testing and quality assurance challenges. This article outlines testing strategies for microservices architectures. The most important thing is understanding the different testing layers and how they complement each other. Unit tests provide fast feedback on implementation correctness at the component level. Integration tests check that components work together as expected. Contract tests verify that services adhere to agreed APIs. Endtoend tests simulate user journeys across multiple services. For quality assurance, automated testing should be maximized to allow time for complex manual testing. Performance testing is also key given the dependence on distributed network calls. Both isolated service endpoints and chains of calls should be load tested. In summary, testing microservices can be more challenging than monolithic architectures, especially with continuous integration/deployment. Understanding the test layers and automating extensively provides confidence in product quality."

Resources are less available and it's frustrating when tutorials don't answer specific questions. Confidence still high from phase 1. Phase 3: Overwhelmed and lost without resources to answer \\\"why\\\" and \\\"which\\\" questions. Confidence drops as competence increases but progress seems limited. Phase 4: Finding a path through phase 3 leads to increased confidence and competence. Able to formulate good questions and find answers. Focus is on best practices and launching production sites. The article asks what resources exist to help get through phase 3, the \\\"Drupal learning cliff.\\\" Responses from Lullabot employees are summarized, suggesting trial and error, mentorship, reading code, building a personal project, and interacting with experienced developers are most helpful. The key is perseverance to make it through this challenging but important phase."

Awareness and simple tricks like reminders can help prevent these tragedies. The article discusses the tragic phenomenon of parents accidentally leaving their children in hot cars, resulting in injury or death. This happens more often than people realize about 40 deaths per year in the US alone. When it does occur, the public response is typically outrage, assuming the parents were negligent. However, psychology professor David Diamond's research shows this is often not the case. Usually the parent's \\\"habit memory\\\" takes over, causing them to overlook the deviation from routine that led to them taking the child that day. Their \\\"prospective memory\\\" fails in the stressful moment. A child's body heats up 35 times faster than an adult's, and death can occur in just minutes. Wellmeaning technologies like Waze's new feature are trying to help address this, but human error remains the biggest factor. Diamond says awareness campaigns explaining how fast hyperthermia happens are most effective. Simple tricks like placing reminders in the front seat can also help counteract our habit memory's autopilot mode. But there is still no foolproof prevention method. This can happen to any loving, conscientious parent, so compassion along with vigilance is warranted."

This makes them up to 80% cheaper than regular VMs for flexible workloads. Google has reduced the price of its preemptible virtual machines by up to 33 percent. Preemptible VMs allow Google to increase utilization when demand is low by offering discounted access, but take away access when demand picks up so they can charge more for regular VMs. Unlike AWS which uses an auction system, Google offers set prices for preemptible VMs that can be up to 80 percent cheaper than regular VMs. However, they can only run for 24 hours. If workloads are flexible, preemptible VMs can offer significant cost savings. Google hopes the price drop will unlock more computing opportunities for tasks like data analysis, media processing, and business operations that can utilize thousands of preemptible VM cores. The move may also drive Amazon to lower its spot instance pricing. For workloads that can't use preemptible VMs, Google has a new VM Rightsizing Recommendation tool to optimize VM sizing."

They learned not to be a gatekeeper, to provide visibility into vulnerabilities, automate security checks, and avoid blaming developers. In 2011, Intuit embarked on revamping QuickBooks Online for better integration of payroll, CRM, and thirdparty services. With its shift to softwareasaservice, Intuit transformed its desktop model so developers could quickly prototype features for customers. A focus was responsive development and continuous rollout in other words, DevOps. Around the same time, massive data breaches raised awareness of security risks. With CRM and payroll integration, Intuit focused on DevOps security. There's no recipe for integrating security into the CI/CD cycle, says Shannon Lietz of Intuit. With 3000 developers, Intuit struggled because security and DevOps teams were separate. Other firms creating cloud services dealt with similar issues. Netflix and Etsy pioneered DevOps security efforts. Key challenges were getting coverage and visibility over applications to defend them, and blocking attacks at scale. Four ways to integrate security into the CI/CD cycle: 1. Don't be a gatekeeper. Provide visibility and tools rather than blocking. 2. Give developers quick visibility into vulnerabilities in their code to tighten feedback loops. 3. Automate security checks and run them continuously. Use cloud APIs for easy access. 4. Don't punish mistakes or blame developers. Remember security teams are learning too. The goal is to secure agile DevOps without interfering with developer goals."

Criticism causes them to learn and strengthen development processes. Maps is a core product for Apple, but developing it is challenging since the data is constantly changing and needs continuous updating. Apple sees maps as a platform that many apps build on top of. Developing maps is expensive with no direct revenue, so only Apple and Google are doing it in a major way. The Maps app received a lot of criticism when it launched in 2012. This was embarrassing but caused Apple to reevaluate the importance of maps and commit to improving it significantly. Maps presented new data quality and integration challenges that Apple did not initially appreciate. The criticism motivated them to strengthen maps development processes and do more beta testing. Maps is an example where Apple had to learn and gain new competencies. This kind of adaptation has happened before as Apple entered new product domains like chips, retail, and mobile devices. Apple takes on hard problems to enable new user experiences. Mistakes will happen but they aim to continually improve. Eddy Cue explains that with Apple's large customer base, even small issues impact millions of users. So quality expectations are high. He believes their products have fewer mistakes than in the past but the bar keeps rising. Craig Federighi adds that Apple values critical feedback because it pushes them to improve.

Steve Wozniak, cofounder of Apple, turns 65 today. Wozniak designed the revolutionary Apple II computer and imbued Apple's early products with his funloving personality. Compared to Steve Jobs, Wozniak was more relatable to tech enthusiasts. He embraced the hobbyist hacking mentality of Silicon Valley's Homebrew Computer Club where the first Apple computer was unveiled. Despite his key role in inventing the personal computer with the Apple II, Wozniak spent his fortune on fun rather than trying to take over the world. Wozniak was known as a prankster, once making a colleague's computer squeak with a hidden mouse. At the 1977 West Coast Computer Faire where the Apple II debuted, Wozniak pranked Jobs with a brochure for a fictional computer. Wozniak's humor made Apple feel different from rival companies. Inside Apple, he defended employees and gave away his own shares so others could have stock options. Wozniak was also a talented engineer, inventing the Disk II floppy drive that increased the Apple II's capabilities. Today, Wozniak continues to have a fun, geeky presence in the tech world with cameos and enthusiasm about technologies like Segways. He also speaks out on making technology more utopian by asking companies to cooperate and keeping the internet free.

The article discusses using Elasticsearch's parent/child relationship feature to efficiently update metadata fields in large documents without reindexing the entire document. The metadata fields that change more frequently, like a 'classification' field, are stored in a separate 'parent' document. The large, mostly static content is stored in a 'child' document. When the metadata changes, only the small parent document needs to be updated, avoiding wasteful reindexing of unchanged content. An example is provided where documents have a 'public' or 'secret' classification field in the parent, and title/body content in the child. Updating the parent classification from 'public' to 'secret' for one document allows efficiently filtering search results without reindexing the large content. This parent/child pattern in Elasticsearch enables selectively updating metadata without the cost of full reindexing."

Microservices architecture was introduced 4 years ago as a way to compose small, unique services around business domains to build complex solutions. It allows interconnected services to be choreographed to give users an uninterrupted experience. However, implementing microservices in large organizations presents challenges. The first challenge is organizational structure. Annual budgeting makes it hard to fund a microservices migration. Ephemeral project teams also don't allow for longstanding teams to own services autonomously. To overcome this, create business incentives for microservices and evolve towards product/service teams. The second challenge is deconstructing legacy monoliths. This involves finding seams around business capabilities and measuring code toxicity. Techniques like the strangler pattern, wrapping the monolith in containers, and refactoring hot spots can help. The third challenge is modeling services. Getting too finegrained too early creates problems. Services should encapsulate business logic and be sized based on organizational maturity. Use user journeys to find the right boundaries. Test boundaries by counting service touches for features. When constructing services, have automated release pipelines first. Find the right granularity balance between complexity and autonomy/speed. Make a leap in empathetic evolution between teams to understand consumer needs. Adopt practices like providing mocks and contract tests."

The article discusses the concept of the \\\"intolerant minority\\\", which states that a small minority of people who are intolerant and stubborn can impose their preferences on the rest of the population. It provides examples such as kosher dietary laws, where a small number of people who only eat kosher can shift food supply chains so everything becomes kosher. Another example is Islamic conversions being irreversible, so any interfaith marriages or conversions over generations can shift a population to being predominantly Muslim. The article argues this explains why Christianity spread in the Roman Empire, as Christians were aggressive proselytizers and intolerant of Roman paganism. It also explains why Arabic spread around the Middle East under Persian rule, since administrators only knew Aramaic.

The goal is to enable independent scaling, failure domains, and team ownership. However, extensive orchestration and automation may not be necessary for smaller teams. Sharing databases across services can be avoided by convention rather than having completely separate data stores per service. 2.

He starts with sketches before creating digital and clay models. His favorite was the Fox compact car. Luiz Alberto Veiga has worked at Volkswagen do Brasil for 38 years and is currently the Director of Design & Package. He explains that a car is extremely complex, with thousands of parts coming together from around the world. Even a simple car door contains many intricate electrical and mechanical systems. Veiga has loved cars since childhood. He started working at Volkswagen as an illustrator at age 22, before becoming a designer. Drawing is his hobby as well as his job. The design process starts with a briefing that outlines the essence of the new car. Designers make hundreds of sketches, which are narrowed down to the best ones. These are rendered digitally before clay models are made. The clay models are further narrowed down until one final design is chosen. This is scanned digitally to create the virtual model. Engineers then build the tools and production lines to manufacture the parts. The whole process takes about 4 years. Veiga's favorite design was the Fox, which he first sketched on a napkin. It was not part of Volkswagen's official plans but was approved directly by the global president. Launched in 2003, the Fox pioneered compact cars with lots of interior space and was the first Brazilian model exported to Germany. Veiga believes Volkswagen design should be timeless and never go out of fashion. He selected 5 cars that represent the brand's history."

Thomas Edison famously said that genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration. As an inventor with over 2000 patents, he knew that generating a large volume of ideas through experimentation and effort was key to innovation. In the digital economy, this strategy is called Agile Growth. The author's company helps clients like CocaCola and Pfizer transform their businesses digitally. They describe this as an iterative journey rather than a destination. Customers expect a seamless experience as companies make the initial leap into digital and remain agile. Efficiency and managing resources well is critical to test more products and ideas. This is why the Cloud is an essential innovation tool, drastically cutting infrastructure costs and app development efforts compared to traditional data centers. This enables companies to accelerate innovation while adapting quickly when needed. The author gives Snapchat as an example of a company using the Cloud to enable growth. Built on Google App Engine, it has scaled to 150 million daily users without outages. For startups, the initial Cloud investment is reasonable and scaling up is simple. While most companies won't need that capacity, doing more with less is always a priority for innovation. With Cloud services, companies can have fast, cheap, and good solutions for testing ideas. This allows focusing on validating hypotheses rather than managing complex infrastructure. There are also security advantages, with major providers having dedicated security teams monitoring systems continuously. The author argues there is no shortage of ideas in business, but severe restrictions on executing them. To innovate, companies must substantially increase their ability to give life to many ideas like Edison.

The article explains how representing users and artists as vectors in a \\\"vector space model\\\" allows finding similarities between not just users and artists, but between any two entities like artists, users, genres etc. IHeartRadio enriches this model by incorporating additional data like live radio stations, podcasts, tracks, genres and user demographics. This enables building a powerful generalized recommender system across different product features. The article concludes by noting that mapping diverse entities into a unified vector space is a powerful technique, enabling many new ways to connect users with content. Upcoming parts will discuss using audio data to map tracks into this space, and techniques to enable rapid prototyping of new recommender systems."

A/B testing involves creating a control group and experimental groups to test different experiences. Netflix runs experiments to generate user data and organize tests properly to get sufficient, useful data. The Netflix homepage changes for different users as part of A/B testing experiments to get people to watch shows. If a user's attention isn't captured in the first 90 seconds, they may lose interest. In 2013, Netflix tested artwork variants to increase viewership for titles. This showed users are sensitive to artwork changes. A/B testing is the most reliable way to learn user behaviors. Designers should think through the lens of experimentation. Use A/B testing to tweak designs and target retention and revenue. See if changes improve these metrics and make successful variants the default. A/B testing validates which UX design is more effective. Netflix's product team used it to improve registration rates from Google Ads. Their intuition was wrong hiding both image and price performed better than just hiding the image. Explore many ideas to find the best ones. Observe what people do, not what they say. Users don't always behave as they claim. Use data to estimate the size of opportunities.

Netflix is rearchitecting to allow teams to own what they build and operate. They are considering two options: 1. Passthrough API with playback orchestration layer. API passes playback requests through to playback orchestration layer, which calls playback services. API still handles nonplayback requests. 2. Separate playback and nonplayback APIs. Cleaner architecture but requires more coordination between teams. Main considerations are developer experience (easier with one API), organizational implications of two teams owning separate APIs, simplicity (two APIs is cleaner), and operational overhead (higher with two APIs). No perfect solution, only tradeoffs. Netflix will experiment with reusable components, then likely build two separate APIs owned by two teams. Goal is to balance ownership with code reuse."

A technique called minibatch discrimination helps maintain sample diversity. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a type of generative model that can learn to generate new data similar to a dataset it is trained on. GANs work by having two neural networks compete against each other in a zerosum game framework. One network, the generator, creates synthetic data instances, while the other network, the discriminator, tries to distinguish between real and synthetic data. The two networks are trained simultaneously, with the generator learning to produce more and more realistic data to fool the discriminator. Recently, GANs have shown promising results in generating realistic images. One key challenge is that the generator can sometimes collapse to a setting where it produces a narrow distribution of similar samples. A technique called minibatch discrimination has been proposed to address this issue by allowing the discriminator to look at multiple samples at once. We implemented a simple GAN in TensorFlow to approximate a 1D Gaussian distribution, and showed how adding minibatch discrimination helps maintain sample diversity during training. GANs are an active area of research for generative modeling and unsupervised learning."

The tech giants Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft are acquiring artificial intelligence startups at a rapid pace. In just the last 5 years, over 30 AI startups have been acquired. Apple's recent purchase of Turi for $200 million is just one example. This consolidation of AI companies and talent by a handful of tech giants is concerning for several reasons. It stunts industry growth, since acquired products are often discontinued. It limits collaboration and innovation, as tech giants hoard IP and talent. And it concentrates AI power and benefits in the hands of a few companies rather than being accessible to all. The author argues this is reminiscent of the monopolies of the early 20th century, like in oil and steel. What's needed is a \\\"trust buster\\\" like Teddy Roosevelt to break up these AI monopolies. That would encourage more competition, collaboration and accessibility. The benefits of AI should not accrue to just a handful of tech giants but rather to everyone."

They succeed when improving experience through speed and convenience in narrow use cases. WeChat shows their advantages. The title of Kik CEO Ted Livingston's Medium post suggests that early attempts by brands at chatbots failed because they focused too much on conversation when users really just want speed and convenience. Livingston argues that the emphasis on \\\"conversational commerce\\\" was a mistake because natural language processing is not yet good enough to manage humanlike conversations. Services like Poncho the Weathercat often frustrate users.

Recent studies show that having a long stride does not necessarily mean more speed. To improve performance and prevent injuries, the ideal is to take shorter steps at a higher cadence. Long strides often cause runners to land on their heels first, increasing impact on joints. Shorter steps with higher cadence are more efficient. Analyzing Olympic athletes, physiologist Jack Daniels found pros have a cadence of at least 180 steps per minute. This became seen as the ideal, but coach Adriana Genioli says each runner should find their natural cadence and work to improve it. To calculate your cadence, count how many times your right foot hits the ground in one minute, then multiply by two. To increase cadence, multiply your cadence by 1.1 as a new goal. This should be done with professional supervision to avoid injury. Five exercises are suggested to improve running mechanics and increase cadence: high and low skipping, anfersen, dribling, hopserlauf, and kick out. These help with posture, heel lift, ankle mobility, and stride length. Gradual increases in cadence along with these exercises can optimize running efficiency."

Uber has faced challenges recently, including exiting the China market after losing billions of dollars fighting local rival Didi Chuxing. This shows cracks in Uber's dominance as it has also lost over $1 billion in the last 6 months. However, Uber may have bigger ambitions beyond ridehailing. It recently revealed progress on selfdriving car technology by launching a pilot in Pittsburgh. Uber also acquired Otto to get into selfdriving trucks, which it sees as a multitrillion dollar opportunity. So while Uber lost China, it is lowering its addressable market in ridehailing but expanding into a new selfdriving transport market including trucks. This could minimize the China loss if Uber can conquer trucking too. Uber's losses are staggering, over $1.2 billion in the first half of 2016. But these may drop now that it has exited China and ended its spend at all costs approach there. Investing in selfdriving technology will still be hugely expensive for Uber but it sees it as necessary for the future. Uber failed at winning China but it can afford that. Its vision is now a logistics platform from human passengers to packages delivered autonomously. So it is routing money into selfdriving cars and trucks instead of fighting over China. Uber is starting its next act without finishing the first. But with its ambitions and valuation, this risky bet on the future may be necessary."

A buffer method copies strings to RAM only when needed. The article discusses the Arduino microcontroller platform and techniques to conserve RAM usage when working with constant strings stored in program memory (PROGMEM). It explains that Arduino boards have limited RAM, often 12KB, so storing constant strings in RAM uses up precious space needed for variables and program operation. Several solutions are presented: Store static string content in EEPROM instead of RAM, but EEPROM is also limited, around 512 bytes. Store static content on an external device like a WiFi shield with more storage. Useful for large content. Use PROGMEM keywords to store strings in flash program memory instead of RAM. But this requires special handling when printing or manipulating strings. A proposed method copies PROGMEM strings to a reusable buffer before printing or using them. This allows normal string usage without changing most code. Simpler preprocessor macros automatically handle copying PROGMEM strings to RAM when printed. But a unique macro is needed for each string. Benchmark tests show the PROGMEM buffer method saves over 1KB RAM versus normal strings, with little extra program size. Conclusion is that PROGMEM helps optimize RAM usage for Arduino constant strings, with the buffer method offering a good balance of RAM savings and easy code use."

The Arduino microcontroller has a limited amount of RAM (random access memory) available. There are two types of RAM SRAM and DRAM. SRAM is faster but more expensive, while DRAM is slower but cheaper. The total RAM is divided into different sections .data, .bss, heap, stack, and sometimes external RAM. When the heap and stack sections collide by growing into each other, the microcontroller will start to malfunction or reset itself. This happens when you don't have enough free RAM. To optimize RAM usage: Avoid dynamic memory allocation with malloc/calloc/realloc, as it can cause fragmentation in the heap. Use local variables on the stack instead. Avoid global and static variables when possible. Use the smallest data types needed (uint8_t instead of uint16_t etc). Store constant data like strings in PROGMEM flash instead of RAM. Keep strings and arrays short. Measuring free RAM can help diagnose RAM issues. The getFreeRam() function shows an approach to measure free RAM in bytes on the Arduino."

An MVP is not about creating a smaller or cheaper version of a product, but rather about starting the process of learning and testing the business model. It provides an example of a startup that wanted to become a data provider in precision agriculture. The team mistakenly thought building an expensive prototype with robots, cameras, and software was necessary for an MVP. However, Steve Blank points out this confuses the purpose of an MVP, which is customer discovery. A cheaper alternative is suggested: renting a camera and plane, manually processing data, and seeing if farmers will pay for it. This allows learning if the product is viable without unnecessary expense.

Insufficient training data limits accuracy. Makoto Koike, a former embedded systems designer from Japan, started helping on his family's cucumber farm and was amazed by the tedious manual labor of sorting cucumbers by size, shape, color, and other attributes. His parents sort cucumbers into 9 classes by hand, taking up to 8 hours per day during peak season. Makoto wanted to automate sorting so farmers could focus on growing. Inspired by Google's AlphaGo beating a top Go player, Makoto decided to try deep learning and TensorFlow to automatically classify cucumber images. He designed a system using Raspberry Pi and cameras to capture images, and TensorFlow neural networks on a Linux server to classify them into quality grades. After training the model on 7,000 images sorted by his mother over 3 months, Makoto achieved 95% validation accuracy but only 70% realworld accuracy due to insufficient training data. He is eager to use Google Cloud ML to train with more data and tune the model. Current challenges are needing large datasets and intensive computing for training."

This courage to focus on people over metrics is key to inspiring others. The Englishman Simon Sinek, a management specialist, believes that courage is the main requirement of inspiring leadership. In his new book \\\"Leaders Are Served Last\\\", he explains his metaphor that good leaders put their teams' interests first, like parents feeding their children before themselves. Sinek traces leadership from the Paleolithic era to today. In caveman times, the strongest alpha males led by protecting the tribe. They earned privileges like first choice of meat and mates by serving the tribe's interests. True leaders sacrifice their own interests to care for their team. Exceptional modern leaders have courage to defend their beliefs, not just charisma. They focus on people, not just systems and metrics. Managers can become leaders by caring for their teams. In times of crisis, leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. don't just make plans, but inspire people to work towards a shared dream."

The debate over using tabs versus spaces for formatting code has existed almost as long as programming itself. In a famous scene from HBO's Silicon Valley, the main character argues with a Facebook engineer over her use of spaces instead of tabs. The aesthetics and readability of code are at the center of this debate. Google Developer Advocate Felipe Hoffa analyzed over 1 billion files from 400,000 top projects on GitHub to settle the tabs versus spaces dispute. He found that across major programming languages, spaces are used far more often than tabs, with some exceptions like C and Go. This suggests spaces have become the dominant standard, despite continued disagreement over which is better. The analysis did not conclusively prove spaces are superior but showed real world usage favors them. So while the debate continues, it appears largely settled in practice as most programmers choose to use spaces over tabs for formatting their code."

The full code is available on GitHub. The author gained experience with microservices on a retail banking project. The project was successful in delivering features quickly using microservices, but the microservices were tightly coupled to legacy components. This tight coupling was due to several factors: Vertically scaled private data center infrastructure Lack of a cloudnative development platform No selfservice database provisioning tool The microservices used the legacy system's large shared database. Access controls provided isolation between microservices. This allowed easy migration to separate databases later. However, it took 7 months to release the first microservice, due to risks of impacting production users. A framework defect caused connection issues during stress testing. The key lesson was that a microservice should encapsulate the unit of service and unit of failure from day one. This refers to a concept by Jim Gray modules should be units of service and failure, so failures don't propagate.

The article discusses how to override the default package deployment behavior in CQ/AEM using the JCR Vault Java API. The default behavior is to delete content on the destination if it does not exist in the source package. To prevent content deletion, you can create a custom package programmatically with the Vault Java API and specify the \\\"merge\\\" import mode. The steps are: 1. Extract the existing package .zip file 2. Edit the METAINF/vault/filter.xml file and specify the root filter with \\\"merge\\\" mode 3. Repackage the content into a new .zip file 4. The new package can now be installed without deleting content on the destination. Other key points: The Vault API has 3 import modes: replace, merge, update You can also use the Vault Maven plugin to create packages with custom import modes The Vault API in CQ is com.day.jcr.vault.fs.api.ImportMode So in summary, using the Vault Java API to create a custom package allows specifying a \\\"merge\\\" import mode to prevent content deletion on package installation."

IPv4 addresses are divided into classes AC to allocate different portions for the network and host sections. Certain ranges are reserved for private networks and loopback. Netmasks indicate which bits represent the network and which represent the host. Subnetting allows dividing a network into smaller sections by borrowing bits from the host portion. CIDR notation specifies the number of significant bits in the network portion rather than using netmasks. Understanding these concepts allows configuring networks and IP addressing schemes properly.

However, Apple has repeatedly exceeded low expectations, like beating earnings estimates this year despite iPhone sales warnings. This pattern continued at the iPhone 7 launch, with exciting surprises like Super Mario Run and advanced iPhone features. Cook's underpromise, overdeliver strategy is paying off, making this an exciting time to be an Apple fan."

Recent work by Henry Lin at Harvard University and Max Tegmark at MIT explains why deep neural networks have been so successful at tasks like image recognition and playing Go. Despite having far fewer parameters than the number of possible functions they approximate, deep neural networks somehow find the right approximations. Lin and Tegmark argue this is because the universe follows a small subset of all possible mathematical functions namely low order polynomials that are symmetric and hierarchical. The laws of physics can be described by simple low order polynomial equations. Hierarchical structure in the universe also makes it easier to model with deep neural networks. This insight means mathematicians can now focus on identifying the specific properties that allow deep learning to work so well. With an improved understanding, advances in deep learning are likely to accelerate. The work also explains why human brains are so adept evolution has selected for a neural structure wellsuited to analyzing the hierarchical nature of our universe."

Researchers filmed bacteria rapidly evolving resistance to antibiotics on a giant petri dish. The timelapse video shows a white bacterial colony spreading across a black dish with bands of increasing antibiotic strength. The colony pauses at each band as it evolves to overcome the antibiotic, before rapidly spreading again. After 2 weeks, the bacteria have become completely resistant to the strongest antibiotic dose. This visually demonstrates how bacteria can quickly adapt to antibiotics, contributing to the rise of dangerous superbugs. The experiment also revealed how fastergrowing resistant strains can outcompete slowergrowing strains, even if the slower strains are more resistant. This phenomenon is difficult to study in traditional petri dishes. The simple visual setup helps illustrate tangible evolution and could enable new research on spatial dynamics of resistance. Demonstrating evolution in action may increase public understanding of how quickly bacteria can gain antibiotic resistance, highlighting the need for more responsible antibiotic prescribing."

The use of biometrics on smartphones is becoming more common in Brazil, gaining consumer trust. Banks already use biometric technology for cash machines, and the next step is mobile payments. Smartphones with biometric authentication can play a big role here. However, some key issues must be addressed first. Safety is a concern due to the sensitivity of biometric data. As the technology evolves, it must achieve a high security level to gain user trust. Biometrics can also help protect personal data by tying a user to a device, so less data needs to be shared. Cost is another issue, as biometric technology can be expensive initially. But costs should fall as adoption rises, making it a worthwhile investment. Standardization is also needed so biometrics can provide a seamless payment experience across devices. The FIDO standard aims to enable universal biometric payments. If security, cost, and standardization concerns are met, biometrics can benefit consumers and merchants with faster, more secure transactions. This could enable new trade possibilities in remote areas without banking infrastructure. Customers want faster, secure payments, and merchants want affordable security that speeds transactions. Biometrics can meet these needs if the key challenges are overcome."

Software defects are very costly. A 2002 study by the Triangle Research Institute for the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology estimated that inadequate software testing costs the U.S. economy $59.5 billion annually. A University of Cambridge study found the global cost of software defects grows by $312 billion per year. On average, developers spend half their time on defect correction. There are five key reasons to invest in test automation: 1. Manual testing alone cannot match the scope of automated testing. Software always has defects, even with extensive manual testing. 2. Manual testing depends on humans who inevitably make mistakes. Automated testing uses robots 24/7. 3. Test coverage increases significantly with automation, which can test thoroughly without supervision across configurations. 4. Automated testing saves time and money. Tests can be repeated endlessly without additional costs. Automation is much faster than manual processes. 5. Studies show test automation has a high return on investment compared to manual testing. The payback period can be less than a year. In summary, test automation increases test coverage, saves time and money, and improves software quality and customer satisfaction.

Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin and Cornell Tech have trained software using standard machine learning techniques that can defeat common privacy protection methods like blurring and pixelation. The software was able to identify obscured faces in videos, objects in pixelated images, and numbers in images protected by the P3 encryption tool. Even when identification rates were not near 100%, they still exceeded random guessing by a large margin, undermining these techniques as effective privacy tools. The researchers used mainstream neural networks trained on large image datasets. After the networks achieved over 90% accuracy on identifying objects, the researchers applied privacy protections like YouTube's blurring to the images. They then trained the networks to interpret the obscured images, using their knowledge of the originals. In tests, identification rates exceeded 8090% for some techniques. The researchers argue this demonstrates serious vulnerabilities in using blurring and pixelation for privacy when machine learning techniques are advancing. They recommend techniques like using black boxes over faces instead of distortions. Their goal is to show that privacy technologies must account for machine learning's capabilities."

Banks are adopting blockchain technology, which underpins bitcoin, to cut costs. However, they are making changes to force it to fit banking norms. Bitcoin was invented in 2009 as an alternative currency system beyond government control. Bankers distrusted bitcoin but saw blockchain as useful it is hard to shut down, transactions can't be reversed, and it is transparent. These appealed to banks initially. But transparency conflicts with bankers' privacy needs. Banks diverge from bitcoin advocates' aims. Banks now want efficiency due to tighter regulation, new competition, and low interest rates. Blockchain may increase speed and reduce costs by automating backoffice functions. But a shared blockchain system could let banks spy on each other. Immutability means fat finger trades can't be reversed, risking losses. Scalability is an issue the more users, the slower it gets. So banks are diluting the pure bitcoin concept. \\\"Blockchain without bitcoin\\\" is a buzzword, but the differences are more than just swapping an engine. Ideas involve limiting data sharing to appropriate parties, not all users. Immutability worries may be overstated trades can be reversed with equal and opposite transactions.

JWTs provide signed but not encrypted tokens, so sensitive data should not be stored in the payload. TL;DR Tokensbased authentication is more relevant than ever with the rise of single page applications (SPAs) and decoupling of frontend and backend. Token authentication is stateless, scalable, allows crossdomain requests, can store data in the token, and has better performance compared to traditional cookiebased authentication. However, token size and where to store tokens are concerns. JWTs are signed but not encrypted so sensitive data should not be stored in the payload.

The article discusses causality and how to represent it mathematically using graphs. It starts by explaining how quantifying causality allows you to make assumptions explicit and avoid biases in data analysis. Causality is represented as a graph, where nodes are variables and arrows indicate causal relationships. This structure has implications for statistical properties like independence and conditional independence. The article walks through examples with two and three variable causal chains, forks, and colliders. It shows how conditioning on certain variables blocks or explains away the effect of others. This is formalized in the backdoor criterion, which gives rules for estimating total causal effects by controlling for variables that satisfy certain graphical criteria. The article relates this to regression analysis. It shows how causal relationships manifest in regressions through coefficients going to zero when you control for variables, indicating confounding paths have been blocked. It also discusses limitations around assuming knowledge of the true causal graph. However, this provides a useful framework for reasoning about biases in estimating causal effects from observational data. Finally, it suggests an application to machine learning for subset selection in regression. Using simulated data, it shows that regressing on only the direct causes of a target variable can outperform lasso regression. So solving the \\\"beta problem\\\" of finding causes helps solve the \\\"yhat problem\\\" of prediction."

This improved results when applied to Google's friend recommendation system. The paper \\\"Egonet Community Mining Applied to Friend Suggestion\\\" was presented at the 42nd International Conference on Very Large Data Bases (VLDB) held in New Delhi, India from September 59. The paper, coauthored by researchers from Google, explores how analyzing the local community structure of egonetworks can improve friend recommendations in social networks. The number of common friends between two users is a widely used feature for friend recommendation systems. However, it has drawbacks. For example, two users may have a common friend but belong to completely different social circles. The paper introduces a technique to suggest friends based on detecting communities in egonetworks independently. The key idea is to construct egonetminusego graphs for all nodes, which only contain the neighbors of a node. In these local egonets, communities are easier to identify compared to the global graph. The algorithm clusters the egonets and only suggests friend pairs that are in the same community from the viewpoint of their common friends. The paper presents efficient parallel and distributed methods to compute and cluster egonets at scale on the entire Google+ graph. When applied to Google's \\\"You May Know\\\" system, this approach improved acceptance rates and decreased rejection rates. Analyzing egonetworks shows promise for friend recommendation and other applications like automatic contact classification and spam detection.

Unilever launched an ecommerce platform aimed at small retailers in São Paulo, Brazil, called Buy Unilever. The goal is to reach 300,000 small shopkeepers who often have difficulty restocking inventory since they are not visited frequently by Unilever representatives. The online platform allows retailers to order products directly from Unilever instead of going to wholesalers. Retailers can register with their CNPJ and get exclusive promotions and tips on increasing profitability. The platform was developed by Infracommerce and offers credit card and bank slip payment options not typically available to small retailers from distributors. It provides the full online purchasing process for retailers from product listing to delivery by Unileverapproved partners who already deliver to retailers. The system is meant to ensure small shops always have Unilever products in stock so consumers can purchase them faster."

First, a traditional Java project called hellojigsaw was created with a br.com.caelum.jigsaw package and JigSaw class. It was compiled and run normally with javac and java commands. To migrate to a modular project, a folder named after the module (br.com.caelum.jigsaw) was created. The Java source was moved into this folder and a moduleinfo.java file was added declaring the module. The project now compiles with javac by pointing to the moduleinfo.java file and executes with java by specifying the module name. Attempting to use Swing failed because javax.swing was not declared as a module dependency. The JDK itself has been modularized into many modules now located in the jmods folder instead of jars. Core java.lang doesn't need to be declared as a dependency. To use Swing, its java.desktop module must be declared as a dependency in moduleinfo.java. Then Swing can be used without issue.

The article discusses some of the technical details and costs associated with certain Java language features and APIs when used on Android. It focuses on hidden costs in terms of increased method counts and memory overhead. It first looks at how nested classes in Java generate separate class files rather than true nesting, and how this can lead to synthetic accessor methods being generated to access private members of the outer class. These extra methods bloat the dex file. It then covers how anonymous classes behave similarly, generating accessor methods when accessing private members. This can easily lead to thousands of extra methods. Next, it examines how generics lead to extra methods being generated due to type erasure one for the generic type and one for Object. Covariant return types also generate extra methods. The article then covers how Java 8 language features like lambdas and method references also increase method counts, with lambdas being particularly costly. It also looks at how common Java collections like HashMap have more overhead in terms of memory and indirection than Android's SparseArray. In summary, the article provides a deep dive into how normal Java coding patterns can incur hidden costs on Android in terms of increased method count and memory overhead. It suggests several ways to avoid these costs, like avoiding access to private members from inner classes, upgrading retrolambda, and using Android's specialized collections."

While some closures are inevitable, branches still serve a purpose for major transactions and building confidence. The author, who is the Money editor at the Guardian, has not visited a bank branch this year. His deputy has only been to the bank about 3 times. Another editor says she has only been twice, just to deposit checks. The author wonders if bank branches will go the way of Blockbuster video stores, which people gradually stopped visiting after Netflix appeared, leading to their disappearance. This week a Nationwide director showed the author a graph indicating you only need about 600 branches in major cities to cover 85% of the population. The data suggests towns under 10,000 people may not warrant a branch. The author notes the big banks have thousands more branches than this model suggests are needed. In 2011 there were 478 million customer visits to UK bank branches. This year it will be under 280 million. Many branches now see very few customers per day. Campaigns against rural branch closures are winding down, recognizing the changing landscape. While branch closures will anger some, especially the elderly, bank executives realize not every branch can go. Branches still provide confidence and boost digital usage. Big transactions are still often done in person. Some branches are being reinvented with video screens to connect customers with remote experts. The next generation may see branches as obsolete as telephone boxes. But for now, branches still serve a purpose for major transactions not yet handled digitally."

Research reveals that banks and credit unions are still requiring customers to visit branches to complete new digital account openings, while other industries offer completely digital experiences. Studies show consumers abandon online account openings due to frustration with poorly designed applications. One study found 40% of digital applications started are never finished, indicating a lack of patience. Despite this, most financial institutions have not improved online account opening, impacting customer satisfaction and account openings. A report sponsored by Kofax shows the industry lags consumer expectations for digital account opening. Less than half of financial institutions offer online account opening, and only 15% offer mobile account opening. Of those offering online account opening, less than half allow the entire process online without visiting a branch. Only 17% of institutions offering mobile account opening allow completion without a branch visit. Nearly threequarters of institutions require inbranch KYC components for digital account opening, not required by regulations. Requiring branch visits often leads staff to restart applications to get credit, reducing digital channel attribution. Over half of institutions don't allow stopping and resuming account opening across channels, and under half allow stopping and resuming on the same channel. Given challenges with digital account opening, abandonment rates are high. Yet under half of institutions measure digital account abandonment to identify and fix issues.

While DRY has advantages, taken to extremes it can lead to overly complex and confusing abstractions that hinder understanding of the code. The author argues that some code duplication can be better than wrongful abstraction. They note that programmers spend more time reading code than writing it, so code clarity and ease of understanding is very important. They advise judging each case of potential duplication on its own merits, considering if the abstraction cost outweighs duplication cost in terms of code complexity and cognitive load. They conclude that DRY is a good principle overall, but should not be followed blindly without considering context and costs.

Senior leader involvement improves training program effectiveness. Building organizational capabilities like leadership development is a top priority for most companies, but many struggle to do so effectively. A McKinsey survey found that while 90% rank capability building as a top 10 priority, only 33% focus training on their most important capability. Leadership was cited as the most critical capability by most, but only 35% focus training on it. The top reason given for focusing on a capability was that it was part of company culture rather than competitive advantage. Only 25% think their training is highly effective in improving performance. Just 33% use training methods beyond onthejob extensively. 50% track direct feedback, but few use other metrics, and a third don't know the return on investment. Lack of resources and unclear vision were cited as top barriers, along with resistance to change. When senior leaders set the agenda, training is more often explicitly linked to business goals. 38% of these companies focus training on their top capability versus 28% overall. Their training programs are also seen as more effective, though still needing improvement. Companies should be more deliberate in aligning training to critical capabilities, focusing on leadership development for greater impact.

This explores incremental blockchain benefits for faster, more efficient money transfer. Spanish banking giant Santander is exploring how to digitize customer cash using the public Ethereum blockchain. The project was revealed by Ether.camp founder Roman Mandeleil at Devcon2. Santander aims to open its bankissued funds to innovators to tap efficiencies. This is a unique project given recent blockchain proofsofconcept and consortiums. Ethereum has over $1 billion market cap and nearly 40,000 daily transactions. The Santander project lets customers convert real bank money into 'Cash ETH' tokens redeemable for paper currency. The tokens represent real money backed by Santander. Customers can get the dollars back anytime. In a demo, a customer created digital money for online merchants via a 'brain wallet' passphrase. Despite past issues, Mandeleil called it statistically secure. Santander now seeks to engage other banks via Ether.camp. They will run hackathons on micropayments use cases. This explores how banks can offer basic accounts for new transactional services. Mandeleil said it's more evolution than revolution to bring incremental blockchain benefits. A public firm using a public blockchain would be a huge leap. It shows regulators blockchains aren't too scary. In the demo, a customer could tokenize, transfer or refund their funds. $350 went to Ethereum, with $1 for gas to execute transactions. Paying gas upfront allotted a preset number of transactions, extendable with more payment. Mandeleil sees the digital dollars as an alternative to PayPal for fast, reliable small transactions. Users could exchange the money, redeemable at Santander. This offers Santander a new way to gain account holders. If approved, scalability is a challenge. Many banks issuing digital cash leads to settlement issues. Mandeleil sees existing crypto conversion tools as a potential solution. Santander is engaging more banks, like the Universal Settlement Coin involving Santander and UBS. More legal work is needed, including licensing. Overall, this explores how banks can leverage blockchains for faster, more efficient money transfer."

Zuul is Netflix's cloud gateway that handles traffic from Netflix users worldwide. It recently underwent a major architectural change from a blocking, multithreaded system (Zuul 1) to an asynchronous, nonblocking system using Netty (Zuul 2). The goal was to enable persistent connections for improved product features, performance, and debugging. However, the results have differed from expectations. Blocking systems use one thread per connection, blocking threads during I/O. Async systems use one thread per core, handling requests via events/callbacks. Async has advantages like lower connection costs and resilience to backend latency. But it is harder to debug. Building Zuul 2 was challenging due to Netflix's blocking assumptions. Much work went into converting blocking logic and eliminating thread locals. The same Zuul filters work in both architectures.

The key findings are: Installing the same bundle to the same location works, but uninstall order matters. Uninstalling in reverse order (FILO) works best. The first package installs and activates the bundle. Subsequent packages just snapshot the existing state since the bundle name/version is unchanged. Uninstalling packages out of order can cause unpredictable behavior like bundle restarting. Installing the bundle in different locations works reasonably. Felix recognizes it's the same bundle and handles it properly. There are some bugs around bundle refresh and incorrect source file tracking, but behavior is ultimately correct. Felix only allows one active instance of a bundle. It activates the highest version and deactivates others. Bundle versions are distinct from package versions.

It then displays a virtual representation of the cube on the screen and solves it stepbystep so the user can follow along on their physical cube. The main technical challenges were color recognition and drawing the 3D cube interface.

The 3D cube was rendered on a 2D Tkinter canvas using custom vector math and camera projection code. This allowed flexible GUI design but could be slow. Integrating OpenCV for the webcam made it hard to embed the video feed in the Tkinter GUI.

This is different from previous phrasebased translation systems. Since its introduction, researchers have proposed techniques to improve NMT like handling rare words, using attention, and breaking words into smaller units. The paper describes how challenges were overcome to make NMT work on large data sets and fast enough for Google Translate. GNMT reduces translation errors by 5585% on major languages. The visualization shows how GNMT encodes the input sentence, pays attention to relevant parts, and decodes the output sentence. GNMT is launched for Chinese to English, translating 18 million sentences per day. It uses TensorFlow and Tensor Processing Units. Machine translation still has significant errors compared to humans. But GNMT is a major milestone, made possible by researchers within Google and the wider community."

On September 28, 1997, Apple debuted its iconic \\\"Think Different\\\" television commercial and print ads. The tagline articulated how Apple under Steve Jobs' leadership would differ from the struggling Apple of the 1990s. \\\"Think Different\\\" marked Jobs' return to Apple and the first Apple ad from agency TBWA Chiat/Day in over a decade, since they had created the infamous \\\"Lemmings\\\" ad in 1985 when Jobs departed. It aimed to convince people that things would be different under Jobs, despite no new products yet. Jobs first tested the \\\"Think Different\\\" phrase at the 1997 Macworld Expo to seem more organic. Copywriters Rob Siltanen and Ken Segall wrote the \\\"Here's to the crazy ones...\\\" ad copy. Jobs recorded a narration but didn't allow it to air. He originally wanted to use a speech from Dead Poets Society until the copy was written. The campaign aimed to be a guiding mission statement like the Apple Values of the 1980s. It was discontinued in 2002 with the iMac G4 but its impact continues today. Tim Cook keeps a copy in his office and Apple updated the trademark in 2009. It remains an iconic campaign expressing Apple's ethos of thinking differently."

This provides aggregate and granular data on content categories. The article discusses how to track articles with multiple tags and categories in Google Analytics. It explains that a common solution is to concatenate all categories into one string separated by delimiters. However, this makes analyzing performance by category difficult. The suggested solution is to create a custom dimension called \\\"Category\\\" to track each category separately. Also create a custom metric called \\\"Category Views\\\" to track views per category. Loop through the categories array and fire an event for each one with the custom dimension and metric. The article provides sample code to implement this solution in Google Tag Manager. Key points: Update the page field on the tracker to ensure correct URL is associated with events. Set nonInteraction to true so events don't impact bounce rate. Create a custom report with \\\"Category\\\" and \\\"Category Views\\\" to analyze performance. This allows analyzing category performance at both aggregate and granular levels. Site owners can then shift resources towards better performing topics and optimize content."

More adjustments expected until consumption improves. Agreements between shopkeepers and shopping center administrators in Brazil, including temporary rental discounts, should help maintain stable occupancy rates in shopping centers this year and into early 2017. Despite some improvement in confidence, consumption remains weak amid Brazil's challenging economy. Occupancy has fallen slightly, but agreements with discounts have provided some stability. Political uncertainty has eased but more economic restructuring is needed before rental values can improve significantly. Shopping center revenue reached 151.5 billion reais in 2015 across 538 centers. Customer visits fell 2.5% in August versus last year. Occupancy rates at major shopping center companies were 9398% in Q2, down slightly. More rental discounts are expected through 2017 until consumption rises and unemployment falls.

Poka Yoke is a quality management technique developed in Japan to prevent defects and reduce costs. The name, which means \\\"errorproofing\\\" in Japanese, was coined by engineer Shigeo Shingo at Toyota in the 1960s. He was frustrated by recurring human errors in Toyota's production, so he began developing simple solutions to avoid mistakes. Over time, the techniques proved very effective and became known as Poka Yoke. The key idea behind Poka Yoke is implementing uncomplicated checks in a process to identify defects early, before they lead to bigger problems later. It can involve redesigning equipment, tools, or processes to make errors impossible or very unlikely. Poka Yoke solutions are simple, lowcost, and integrated where failures occur. Poka Yoke can be applied in manufacturing as well as service businesses to reduce costs from human errors, process failures, and product defects. Experts recommend six steps: 1) Identify the defect to correct 2) Understand the causes 3) Consider prevention solutions 4) Verify solution effectiveness 5) Deploy the solution companywide 6) Document the results. Overall, Poka Yoke is a proven quality management method to eliminate defects and improve processes in a costeffective way."

This positions Facebook to compete with existing marketplaces. Facebook has created its own ecommerce tool that allows users in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand to buy and sell products directly on the platform. Users over 18 will see a shopping icon on their home screen that allows them to search for products filtered by location, type, and price. When selecting a product, users can view the seller's profile and product description. However, Facebook does not facilitate payments or delivery, which must be arranged between buyer and seller. With over 1.5 billion users, established marketplaces like eBay and Craigslist may be impacted by this new Facebook feature. Though starting in just four countries initially, the ecommerce tool is expected to expand to other places in the coming months on both iOS and Android apps as well as the web."

The article discusses how interruptions like meetings and notifications can destroy productivity and prevent developers from reaching flow states where they do their best work. Studies show open plan offices are disliked and reduce productivity, but employers use them to pack in more people. The article recommends three tips to improve productivity: 1. Turn off unnecessary notifications on your devices so you aren't constantly interrupted. Only leave on essential notifications. 2. Dodge unnecessary meetings by asking people to explain topics over email or chat instead of defaulting to meetings. Don't commit time unless it's clear a meeting is needed. 3. Ask for a private office or work from home if possible. Working remotely improves productivity by 13% partly by avoiding office distractions. If remote work isn't possible, a private office also helps avoid distractions. The article cites research on interruptions, open plan offices, working remotely, and achieving flow states. It argues we need to work asynchronously and protect focus time to do creative work. The book Creativity Inc is also recommended for ideas on improving team productivity."

It accurately measures 20ms differences in page load time. Several years ago, Facebook's website was mostly rendered on the serverside, with minimal clientside JavaScript. Tools for optimizing load times focused on server performance. Now, Facebook uses clientside frameworks like React, so browser rendering and scripting have become major bottlenecks. In 2016, Facebook found that most load time was spent on the clientside. To prevent client performance regressions from reaching production, they built BrowserLab to analyze the performance of every code change. With thousands of commits daily, even small 20ms regressions add up. BrowserLab catches these, and has helped remove over 350ms from page loads. Initial attempts used WebDriver to load Facebook with and without a commit, but had high variance of 500ms. Analysis identified sources of noise: Environment hardware and software unpredictability Dynamic data constantly changing content Code nondeterminism randomness in ranking and sampling To address this, BrowserLab: Uses a proxy cache to isolate client performance Provides consistent data views between servers Replaces random functions with deterministic versions It measures performance across 50 trials for representative users. Change point analysis detects regressions, triggering automated bisects to identify culprit commits. BrowserLab accurately measures 20ms differences, preventing regressions and identifying optimizations. Future work includes testing mobile web and interactions beyond initial page load."

The article discusses common naming antipatterns in code that make it harder to understand. Some examples include: Using parameter names for arguments instead of more descriptive names based on the specific context. Naming classes based on the interfaces they implement rather than their actual purpose. Using vague, generic names like \\\"Service\\\" instead of more specific names that describe responsibilities. Naming variables based only on their type instead of also indicating their meaning and purpose. Not expressing key information through parameter names that would make intention clearer. Using misleading contextdependent names like a flag called \\\"enableAdvancedSearch\\\" that doesn't relate to search but duplicate detection.

The concept of bimodal IT was created by Gartner a few years ago. It refers to companies maintaining two separate systems one focused on stability and legacy systems, the other on rapid digital innovation. The author initially found this idea interesting, but now believes it is flawed after further reflection and reading other perspectives. The main issues with bimodal IT according to the author: It reinforces the false idea that companies can gradually adopt disruptive technologies without much disruption to their business models, processes, and organizational structures. However, the pace of change today requires quick adaptation. It causes conflicts between the \\\"legacy\\\" and \\\"innovative\\\" groups within an organization. True digital transformation requires companywide agility. Traditional IT methods like waterfall are too linear and predictable for today's unpredictable business environment driven by exponential technological change. Bimodal was created partly because consultancies wanted to tell clients what they wanted to hear that disruption can be controlled rather than the full truth. To transition to fully agile, the author recommends: Creating a digital culture across the company, not just IT. Increased collaboration between IT and business units. Break down silos. Carefully choosing project leaders who embrace agile philosophies. Automating tasks for faster software development. Implementing agile gradually but urgently. Recognize it requires broad cultural change. Using bimodal as a temporary stepping stone to full agility, not an end state."

Structs over classes and generics over protocols avoid runtime costs. Application performance can be impacted by many factors in Swift code. Looking at real world examples, we'll explore performance costs of protocols, generics, structs, and classes for data parsing, mapping, and persistence. Key factors that can cause slowdowns: Object allocation and deallocation. Stack allocation is fast, but heap allocation is slower due to complexity. Reference counting for memory management. Lots of retain/release calls add up. Dynamic dispatch takes more time than static dispatch or inlining. Classes allocate everything on the heap. Structs try to use stack allocation. Protocols require existential containers and protocol witness tables for dynamic dispatch. This causes major slowdowns compared to static dispatch. Generics allow compiletime specialization, avoiding runtime costs of protocols. Modeling data properly is crucial. Enums over strings, value types over classes where possible. In summary, understand tradeoffs of language features, minimize allocations, leverage compiletime optimizations like generics, and model data efficiently. This enables writing high performance Swift applications."

Both allow flexibility. The Java community has seen many lightweight containers emerge to help assemble components from different projects into an application. These containers use a common pattern called \\\"Inversion of Control\\\" to perform wiring between components. This article explores a more specific form of this pattern called \\\"Dependency Injection\\\" and contrasts it with the Service Locator alternative. The choice between Dependency Injection and Service Locator is less important than the principle of separating configuration from use. Dependency Injection works by having a separate assembler object populate fields in a class with appropriate implementations of interfaces. This removes the dependency between the class and the concrete implementation. There are three styles of Dependency Injection: Constructor Injection, Setter Injection, and Interface Injection. An alternative is the Service Locator pattern, where a locator object provides implementations for services when needed. Both Dependency Injection and Service Locator allow swapping implementations for testing and deployment flexibility. For application classes, they are roughly equivalent but Service Locator may be slightly better due to more straightforward behavior. For reusable classes, Dependency Injection is better. When choosing between the two, following constructor injection is best unless there are specific problems. Then switch to setter injection. Overall, separating service configuration from use is more important than the choice between Dependency Injection and Service Locator."

The Americans with Disabilities Act was passed in 1990 to remove barriers for people with disabilities in areas like transportation and employment. Since then, new technologies have emerged that raise questions about web accessibility. At the 2016 Accessibility Summit, speakers from organizations like the W3C and Adobe discussed making the web accessible for people with disabilities like low vision, blindness, deafness, and limited dexterity. The key takeaway is that accessibility should not just be a checklist, but rather a holistic userfocused approach relying on empathy. Accessibility issues are user experience issues. Some ways to build in accessibility: Create personas for disabled users to address their needs during design. The W3C provides sample personas. Create tickets for development based on success criteria for these personas. Incorporate accessibility guidelines from the start of the design process, like contrast checking color combinations. Simplify tasks during UI design to minimize steps. This benefits all users but especially disabled users. Use auditing tools during development to check compliance with guidelines. Try using the site with screen readers and keyboard only. Demo this to clients. Recruit disabled individuals for usability testing. Guidelines alone don't guarantee accessibility. Some other tips: Use flyingfocus.js to enhance interactive element focus states when tabbing. Add skip links to bypass repetitive content. Use ARIA roles sparingly and avoid assumptions. Be specific with \\\"Read more\\\" links for screen readers. Limit line length to 80 characters for readability. Avoid screen reader detection and tabindex.

This allows showing a preview instantly while retrieving the full image. The Facebook engineering team worked to improve the loading speed of cover photos, which are often slow to load especially on lowconnectivity networks. Cover photos can reach 100KB even after compression, and require two network requests one for the photo URL and one to retrieve the image bytes. To address this, the team aimed to create a 200 byte visual impression of the image to include directly in the initial network request, removing the need for a second request. They determined a 42x42 pixel image provided sufficient fidelity once blurred, but JPEG compression with a standard header exceeded 200 bytes. By using a predefined JPEG header stored on the client and transmitting only a version number, width, height, and ~200 byte payload, they could reconstruct the image on the client by appending the payload to the stored header. This allowed reusing JPEG compression while meeting the 200 byte target. Implementing this optimized format reduced profile/page load times by 30% on slow connections and ensured immediate cover photo previews on all connections."

The article describes how to control Lego Power Functions motors and receivers using a Raspberry Pi computer. Power Functions allow Lego models to be motorized, but normally require a handheld infrared controller. The author built an infrared LED transmitter circuit connected to the Pi's GPIO pins. Software on the Pi uses the open source LIRC package to encode and transmit the appropriate Lego control signals. The signals are documented in a Lego technical document. Additional software generates the correct checksums and PWM signals for precise motor control. To control the system from Scratch, the author enabled remote sensor connections in Scratch to create a server. A Python script using the scratchpy library listens for broadcast messages from Scratch containing Lego commands. It then sends these via LIRC to the infrared transmitter. The author tested the system by having a child control a Lego model with Scratch. The components and approach allow Lego Power Functions to be controlled from Scratch on a Raspberry Pi, providing a low cost way to explore coding and robotics."

Recent research from OpenAI and Google shows a way to build AI that never sees personal data, but is able to function as if it had. The system is compared to medical school, where doctors teach students without divulging private medical histories of patients. The \\\"student\\\" algorithm learns to mimic decisions of \\\"teacher\\\" algorithms through millions of simulated decisions, but doesn't have the underlying sensitive information. The teachers are only used for training and never see real data. The student also learns from public, nonsensitive data to further obscure the teachers' data. This approach builds on previous research using multiple teachers, but makes the process faster and less reliant on teachers. The code has been released for others to adapt. Using many teachers makes reverseengineering harder, since the student doesn't rely on any one data point. Even if reverseengineered, an attacker couldn't get information. This could help develop medical AI by crowdsourcing across hospitals, keeping records private. Companies like Google could also use it to learn from users' photos without seeing them. Each user's AI would be a teacher for a student AI in Google Photos. This is a form of differential privacy, which keeps individual data safe in a large database. There is a tradeoff between privacy and utility more privacy means lower utility. But they've gotten the student AI to perform within 2% of teachers, down from 5% previously."

Apple Watch remains the market leader but saw a 72% drop. The new Apple Watch Series 2 release late in Q3 and Android Wear delays contributed to the decline. Smartwatch shipments declined significantly in Q3 2016 compared to Q3 2015 according to a new industry report from IDC. Just 2.7 million units were shipped in Q3 2016, down 51.6% from 5.6 million in Q3 2015. Apple Watch is the market leader but saw a 72% yearoveryear decline in shipments to 1.1 million units. The Q3 2015 numbers were boosted by the initial widespread retail availability of the first Apple Watch after its limited online launch. Many consumers also likely held off purchasing the first generation Apple Watch knowing the Series 2 was going to be announced in September. The new Apple Watch Series 2 only had two weeks of availability in Q3 which impacted numbers. Other factors impacting the decline cited by IDC include Android Wear delays and poor launch timings by vendors. However, Apple Watch Series 2 additions like water resistance could broaden appeal. With holiday shopping approaching, Apple Watch sales may rebound in Q4 as the new model is purchased as gifts. Google's delayed release of Android Wear 2.0 has forced vendors to decide between older or newer OS models for the holidays. Samsung's newly announced Gear S3 smartwatch also hasn't been released yet. IDC concludes smartwatches currently don't appeal to everyone and vendors need to differentiate from smartphones by focusing on areas like fitness tracking. Notable vendor performances highlighted by IDC include Garmin posting the largest increase due to its ConnectIQ smartwatches and Lenovo posting the largest decline due to no new products and scarcity issues."

The author collected a dataset of over 80,000 images of partially completed handwritten digits using a web app. The images are preprocessed using skimage into grayscale arrays. A classifier is built using Tensorflow, training on batches of the image data. The model is deployed via ScienceOps and connected to a web app that generates predictions in realtime as the user draws each digit. The author reflects on the experience building the new handwriting recognition system, the challenges of using Tensorflow, and provides links to resources for further reading on image recognition."

In contrast, Slack aligns incentives by encouraging complementary apps. The Twitter API was extremely open in the early days, enabling many thirdparty clients. However, as Twitter's business model evolved towards advertising, it became important for Twitter to control the user experience. Twitter limited API access to prevent competitive thirdparty clients from growing too large. This damaged trust in the ecosystem. In contrast, Slack has aligned incentives with its ecosystem by encouraging complementary thirdparty apps that enrich Slack's core functionality. Slack invests in the ecosystem through an app directory, developer support, and a fund that invests directly in apps. This creates a thriving ecosystem where all participants benefit. Managing a healthy API ecosystem requires significant investment and planning. Companies must set clear policies, enable valuable integrations, discourage competitive clones, and demonstrate commitment.

Many companies approach their data with the sole goal of monetizing it. However, this approach is inefficient and misses the real opportunity. Rather than looking at data in isolation, companies should start by identifying business problems that exist and that data can help solve. These problems generally fall into three categories: 1. Core customer problems the company already solves but could improve upon with data. 2. New customer problems that haven't been solved yet but could be with data. 3. Operational problems that cost the company money. Once a problem is identified, consider who needs to take action to solve it. Then understand how they currently get information to take that action. The goal should be to build or augment an application that allows the user to take meaningful action related to solving the problem. Data can then be used to optimize that action by providing personalized recommendations, predictions, or other decision support directly in the application interface. Developing sophisticated analytical models and delivering the insights at the right time and place requires capabilities like parallel processing and continuous delivery. If done well, datadriven features anticipate user needs and change behavior for the better. Ultimately, the value comes from getting data insights into the hands of users when they need them to take smarter actions.

Technology and software companies that excel at retaining customers grow faster than their competitors. Companies typically track customer churn, gross revenue churn, and net revenue churn. Net revenue churn is the most comprehensive metric as it captures lost revenue from churning customers and gained revenue from expansion. Analysis shows top performing companies have much lower net revenue churn compared to average companies. This is driven by lower gross revenue churn rather than customer churn or expansion revenue. Focusing on gross revenue churn is key as it accounts for the fact that some customers are more valuable than others. Top performers achieve low gross revenue churn by: Investing appropriately in customer success teams based on customer needs Considering the full customer journey and tailoring the approach Using analytics to predict churn risk and prioritize resources Tracking metrics like renewal rate, customer satisfaction, and feature adoption Letting customer success teams share insights across the organization In summary, a relentless focus on customer success through lower gross revenue churn allows companies to complement sales efforts and accelerate growth."

There are plans to add extensible base media functionality in a future 8.x release to provide a simple solution while allowing contributed modules to enhance it. The media handling capabilities in Drupal 8 core are currently limited. For example, images can be uploaded and embedded in posts using a WYSIWYG editor, but there is no builtin way to reuse files across posts or manage media assets. While contributed modules like Lightning, Thunder, and NP8 provide more robust solutions, most sites do not use these distributions. This creates challenges for both endusers and developers. Endusers must figure out which modules to use, and installing/configuring them can be difficult. Developers must decide which competing solutions to integrate with or support them all. To improve this, there are plans to add extensible base media functionality in a future version of Drupal 8, likely 8.3 or 8.4. This will include a media entity type with plugins for different media types (initially images and YouTube videos), support for reusing media assets across posts, a media library for browsing assets, and the ability to embed remote media. The goal is to provide a simple media solution for basic use cases while still allowing contributed modules to provide more advanced functionality. Dedicated sprints are needed to fully implement this, so organizations are being sought to help fund them. The media team already meets weekly and there are many contributors, but focused sprints would significantly advance the initiative. Overall, the plan is similar to how multilingual support was improved in Drupal 8 core after being fragmented across many contributed modules in Drupal 7."

The article discusses mobile accessibility testing and how it compares to desktop accessibility testing. It explains that many mobile users need accessible sites, including blind users, those with low vision, cognitive issues, or dexterity issues. The main tools needed for mobile accessibility testing are screen readers, color contrast analyzers, HTML validators, and builtin accessibility options on phones. Screen readers allow you to navigate and read pages nonvisually and are built into mobile operating systems. Color contrast analyzers ensure text colors have enough contrast from backgrounds for readability. HTML validators check for proper semantics, but may return false positives. Accessibility options like zoom are useful but not required for audits. The article states mobile and desktop accessibility testing have a lot of overlap. On both, test zooming, color contrast, readability, navigation, and use WCAG 2.0 guidelines. Key differences are mobile uses gestures with screen readers versus keyboard shortcuts on desktops.

The election map shows Donald Trump winning 306 electoral votes to Hillary Clinton's 232. Trump won swing states like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania that were considered part of the \\\"blue wall\\\" for Democrats. This signals a major shift for both parties. The Republican Party is now more populist, while Democrats may need to rebuild their coalition. The cultural divide between urban coastal cities and the rest of the country has widened. Clinton is likely to win the popular vote by 12 percentage points when all remaining votes are counted. If just 1% of voters had shifted from Trump to Clinton, she would have won key states and the electoral college 307 to 231. In that scenario, the narrative would be very different that the country rejected Trump's divisiveness and embraced progressive values. This shows how a small shift in votes can dramatically change the interpretation of an election. The truth likely lies somewhere in the middle. The same electorate that chose Obama four years ago has now elected Trump. Small differences can have major Electoral College implications."

This raises questions on preserving authenticity. Major consumer brands are struggling as they lose billions in market share to smaller, more innovative brands. Large consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies spend very little on research and development (R&D) around 2% of revenue compared to around 15% on marketing. This lack of investment in innovation leaves them unable to compete with more agile startups. Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) have become CPG giants' main strategy for growth and innovation. Rather than develop new products themselves, they acquire smaller brands that have already done so. Unilever, for example, spent only 1.9% on R&D but acquired Dollar Shave Club for $1 billion and Seventh Generation for $700 million. This trend mirrors the pharmaceutical industry, where conglomerates skip R&D and just acquire innovative formulas. The big question is whether CPG giants can preserve the authenticity of acquired brands. If not, they will be back where they started. But the forces driving more M&A are only growing, signaling an impending \\\"M&A avalanche\\\" as big brands continue outsourcing innovation."

R3, based in New York, runs a consortium of over 70 financial institutions. It now plans to give consortium bank members a 60% equity stake in its blockchain business in exchange for the funding. Goldman Sachs is not renewing its R3 membership and will not invest. Most other banks have agreed to the new deal terms, but R3 does not expect all members to participate. The fundraising will be done in phases over 912 months. Banks will also acquire a stake in R3's blockchain technology development lab. Originally R3 planned to give investors stakes in a shared services company it would run for 10 years, but this plan has changed. R3's original 42 members can invest first, followed by development lab members. If the $150 million target is not reached, the round will be opened to strategic investors like tech companies. R3 has rapidly gained support from major banks since starting in 2015. Banks have so far paid membership fees to participate. R3 comes up with ways for the finance industry to use blockchain software. The new deal gives banks stakes in both R3's consortium and the development lab."

Olof Schybergson and Shelley Evenson argue that design thinking alone is not enough for organizations to innovate successfully. They propose the \\\"Design Rule of 3\\\": combining design thinking, design doing, and design culture. Design thinking involves empathy, cocreation, and prototyping. But it must be paired with design doing the actual creation process led by experts. This requires diverse teams and flexible workspaces. Finally, design culture is crucial. This means recruiting change agents, enabling continuous learning, and creating open work environments. With commitment over years, not months, design can become an organization's sustainable differentiator. Google is an example that improved through this approach. The company established a common design language and gave designers more influence. This helped unify Google's offerings into a coherent family of products. Commerzbank is trying to instill design from within instead of acquiring a consultancy. The shift in mindset and culture will take time. An effective design system based on the Design Rule of 3 can boost performance and value. By putting people first, design creates enduring customer relationships and a happier workforce."

Allinone solutions like Sensedia provide deployment and management. Microservices architecture has become popular for building scalable and modular applications by decomposing them into independent services. However, integrating microservices with legacy systems that don't have standard interfaces like REST APIs can be challenging. The common solution is to build an adapter or integration layer to expose the legacy system's functionality as a RESTful microservice. These adapters should follow best practices like being lightweight, scalable, and using common standards like Swagger. Popular Java frameworks like Spring Boot and Apache Camel are good choices. Once built, microservices should be deployed to a PaaS like Cloud Foundry, OpenShift or Heroku for containerization, orchestration, monitoring, etc. This provides scalability and automation. Exposed microservices should then be managed by an API Management platform. This provides security, access control, caching, analytics and more. Sensedia API Management Suite offers integrated microservice deployment through its BaaS feature as well as full API management capabilities.

The Activity holds a reference to the AsyncTask instead of the background task holding a reference back to the Activity. This breaks the potential circular reference and leak. The author believes modeling and architecture should prevent most leaks, and WeakReference indicates a lack of good design rather than being a best practice. Proper scoping and management of references can avoid the need for WeakReference in many cases."

The article summarizes recent research showing the benefits of meditation on the brain. Studies have found meditation leads to changes in brain structure and function, such as increased grey matter volume, reduced default mode network activity, and enhanced connectivity between brain regions. These brain changes are associated with reduced symptoms of depression, anxiety and pain as well as improved attention, concentration and overall wellbeing. Even short meditation programs of just a few weeks can increase cognitive skills like focus, memory and verbal reasoning ability. Meditation has been shown to help with addiction recovery by improving selfcontrol brain regions. In schools, meditation reduces suspensions and improves academic performance. While not a cureall, meditation is a simple practice with proven benefits for mental and physical health that is worth trying. The research shows even just a few minutes a day can make a difference."

In tests, the AI system detected 90% of hidden metallic objects and had a low false positive rate. The researchers plan to test the system on real containers soon. If successful, the AI could be integrated into Rapiscan's systems within months to greatly speed up scanning.

This involves trained staff, investment, and empowering professionals and patients. Digital transformation in healthcare requires more than just adopting new technologies. A cultural change is needed, uniting all areas of healthcare and professionals. This change starts with recognizing the importance of digitalization for care and safety. It involves three key pillars: reinventing the business model, processes, and working methods. Institutions must proactively adapt to evolving patient needs and demographics through detailed planning, investment, and trained staff. The new business model should integrate wellbeing, prevention, monitoring, and patientfocused care; specialize in institutional strengths; share research for modern personalized therapies; address emerging segments like corporate health and medical tourism; and balance supply and demand. New processes should connect specialists and patients through a digital strategy focused on: a realtime digital core; patient participation for personalized, valuable care; employee empowerment; and optimizing care with data insights. Quality planning and management can drive cultural change. This model modifies how professionals work, with more informed patients, nurse caregivers, easier clinical decisions, and more research opportunities.

Stealthy and unavoidable, scope creep hovers over every software development project. Scope creep is when a project grows beyond its original scope while in progress. It happens for various reasons like changing market conditions, user feedback, or poor planning. Scope creep is not necessarily bad, as it shows a team is iterating and reacting to input. But unmanaged scope creep causes delays and unnecessary code. To identify scope creep, the JIRA Agile team uses burndown charts and sprint health widgets to spot unplanned work added midsprint. The Fusion team relies on early integration testing and crossteam meetings to surface issues like scope creep. Once identified, understanding the impact involves estimating new stories and modeling release scenarios. The JIRA team discusses tradeoffs, while the Fusion team \\\"plays with the levers\\\" in Portfolio to balance scope, timelines, and resources. To reorganize based on added scope, the JIRA team uses epic and release burndown charts to see workload growth and make decisions about minimum viable product scope. The Fusion team leans on Portfolio's whatif scenarios to rearrange the backlog and roadmap. Finally, both teams emphasize clear communication about scope creep, through retrospectives and accessible tools like Portfolio, so everyone understands why scope was added and how plans have changed."

The activity starts the service using startService() and passes input data through intent extras. The service processes each intent request and can then use sendBroadcast() to send back results. The activity has a BroadcastReceiver that gets the result and updates the UI. Using an IntentService allows multiple requests to be queued up so the UI stays responsive.

The deadline may be changed to 15 days or interest rates adjusted instead. Nubank, one of Brazil's fastest growing credit card issuers, says it may have to close down if the Central Bank confirms a change in the payment deadline for credit card sales from 30 to 2 days. The change is intended to help retailers by getting them paid faster, but Nubank says the shorter timeframe will impose huge costs on smaller card issuers like itself who lack the funding of large banks. Nubank gets paid by customers about 26 days after a purchase but has to pay retailers in 2 days under the new rule, leaving a large funding gap. Even 15 days would require Nubank to raise $1 billion in capital overnight, which it says is not feasible. The company's cofounder says the 2 day deadline would be \\\"apocalyptic\\\" and force Nubank to close. Analysts also worry the rule could hurt smaller payment processors that partner with retailers. The government may opt to change interest rates instead of the payment deadline. A Central Bank decision is expected Tuesday."

The softness enables high sensitivity. Researchers at AMBER, the materials science research center at Trinity College Dublin, have created a new composite material by combining graphene with Silly Putty. Adding graphene nanosheets to the putty dramatically changed its electromechanical properties, turning it into an extremely sensitive strain sensor. Stretching the material by just 1% causes the current to change by a factor of 5. In tests, the researchers placed the composite on people's chests and necks to measure breathing, pulse, and blood pressure with unprecedented sensitivity. The softness of the putty is key to the high sensitivity. Most prior work on graphene composites used hard polymers, aiming to make them stronger. Little research combined graphene with soft polymers like Silly Putty. The researchers believe this material could enable continuous, lowcost monitoring of pulse and blood pressure. Commercialization seems straightforward graphene and Silly Putty are commercially available, and mixing them is simple. The sensing device would need a housing, electronics, and a mobile app. But these are all offtheshelf components.

Requires Android Lollipop+. The article discusses a new optimization technique implemented in RecyclerView in Android 25.1 to improve scrolling smoothness. The problem is that when RecyclerView needs to display new items coming on screen during a scroll, it can cause jank and frame drops while creating and binding the new views. The solution is to prefetch and prepare these views during idle gaps between frames before they are needed, so the work is already done when it comes time to display them. This is done by scheduling a prefetch Runnable when scrolling starts that binds and creates views that will soon come on screen. The system predicts durations based on past averages and fits work into idle gaps. Caveats are that work may be wasted if prefetched items don't come on screen, and it requires Android Lollipop and later to parallelize work. To use it, update to Support Library 25+ and enable prefetching. Tune create/bind methods for efficiency. Can toggle prefetching and profile to see improvements."

With CocaCola's CEO stepping down, it appears the company is transitioning away from this startup funding model. CocaCola did not comment on the shutdown. The startups that already received funding will continue to get internal support. It's unclear if this signals a broader move away from corporate venture funding or is just isolated to CocaCola's leadership change."

An open and decentralized model may work better. In 2014, the Canadian government began a project to consolidate all government websites onto a single domain, Canada.ca. A $1.54 million contract was awarded in 2015 to a proprietary vendor to build a content management system. The project is now a year behind schedule and 10 times over budget, approaching $10 million. Only 0.05% of the 17 million page migration has been completed. Many consider the project a disservice to citizens. The root issues appear to be attempting to migrate 1,500 departments and 17 million pages onto one site, and using a proprietary vendor instead of leveraging Canada's open source capabilities. While a single site can work, like Boston.gov's 200,000 pages across 120 departments, Canada.ca is 85 times larger. Most organizations successfully use a hub and spoke model where sites share code and infrastructure but allow flexibility. Australia provides a positive example with govCMS, built on Drupal and supporting 52 agencies across 6 jurisdictions. It allows governance without complete control. Departments can innovate independently while benefiting from shared templates and infrastructure. For example, a federal and state agency collaborated to build a data visualization module that both now use. An open source, decentralized model is the best approach for large digital transformations. It enables frictionless sharing and innovation without losing control. Seeing success stories like Australia can help shift perspectives away from reliance on proprietary vendors and centralized control. With ample Drupal expertise, Canada would benefit from hitting pause, learning from other governments, and charting a more collaborative open source path forward."

Alejandro Formanchuk from Argentina is passionate about employer branding and organizational communication challenges. He dislikes terms like \\\"internal customer\\\" and \\\"internal audience\\\" for employees, finding them disrespectful. Employees work over 8 hours a day and are the main actors, not an audience. Formanchuk runs a consultancy, teaches at the University of Buenos Aires, and has published free ebooks on employer branding like \\\"Internal Branding an intelligent plot\\\" (2011). Formanchuk says multiple areas should handle employer branding: internal communication, HR, marketing, leadership. Calling employees \\\"customers\\\" implies outsiders have more value. Employees can't choose where to work like customers choose products. Firing an employee isn't like exchanging a product. Employees receive money rather than give it to the company. Employees experience the company daily, filtering incoming messages through direct perception. Formanchuk dislikes \\\"internal audience\\\" because employees actively build the company daily, they aren't a passive audience. Ordinary employees shape external perceptions of the company sincerely. A strong external brand must be experienced internally for coherence.

Its talent and research align with Google's AI interests. DeepMind is an artificial intelligence company located in London that was acquired by Google in 2014 for $660 million. DeepMind's office is modest and unassuming despite the high profile acquisition. DeepMind was attractive to Google because it gives Google an advantage in the AI talent race against competitors like Facebook and Microsoft. DeepMind has top AI researchers and has achieved prestigious publications in Nature magazine. DeepMind's long term mission is to create general artificial intelligence that can think as broadly as a human. This differentiates it from Google's existing AI efforts focused on deep learning. Being acquired by Google gives DeepMind access to computing power and funding to focus on research over profits. DeepMind operates somewhat independently in London rather than Google's Silicon Valley headquarters. If DeepMind succeeds in general AI, it would be very valuable to Google by providing an intelligent digital employee. But DeepMind operates on a 20 year timeline for its research. Even without achieving general AI, DeepMind's incremental AI advances can benefit Google, like a recent project that cut electricity use in Google data centers by 40%. DeepMind is also working on healthcare AI applications through a deal with UK's NHS. DeepMind claims it does not need large datasets like other AI techniques. But its successes so far have relied on access to domainspecific data. This could raise privacy concerns if expanded.

They hope for reassurance but must soon deal with the reality of Trump's presidency. The election of Donald Trump has surprised and unsettled America's allies, who are hoping for reassurance but remain concerned about his contradictory statements on foreign policy. During the campaign, Trump suggested allies like Japan and NATO members should pay more for their defense or even build their own nuclear arsenals. But after the election, Trump has been more reassuring in calls with leaders. Shinzo Abe said he was convinced Trump was a leader he could trust. South Korea was also reassured that the U.S. would maintain its alliance. Trump has walked back some criticism of NATO, speaking positively about its counterterrorism efforts. Angela Merkel hinted at disquiet by saying U.S.German cooperation depends on shared values. With little policy guidance during the campaign, it is unclear what Trump's doctrine will be. He likely believes the U.S. gets little benefit from its alliances and should make allies pay more. But his Pentagon pick Jim Mattis is committed to U.S. leadership. The truth is allies have no idea what to expect. Fighting terrorism will be a priority, with possibly more troops sent to fight ISIS and the Taliban. Relations with Iran will likely suffer. Allies in the Middle East welcome Trump's antiIran stance but his rhetoric on Islam is troubling. If Trump partners with Russia on Syria, it could strengthen Iran's hand. In Europe, NATO members will try to show their increasing commitments to defense spending and operations. But Trump's dealmaking approach to foreign policy could divide NATO over issues like Ukraine. America's core Asian allies, Japan and South Korea, are well positioned given their growing capabilities and contributions. But across the board, allies will be pressed to spend more on defense. Once in office, Trump's approach will become clearer. He may delegate foreign policy to others like Mattis. Or his transactional doctrine could disrupt alliances. Either way, allies must soon stop guessing and deal with the reality of Trump's presidency."

The author has worked as an Android developer for 5 years and collaborated with engineers of varying backgrounds. Some were experienced enterprise developers, while others were recent college graduates or selftaught. Based on this experience, the author provides advice on hiring Android developers. Mobile app development is often mistakenly seen as easy, but in reality it is challenging to build high quality apps. The Play Store has few excellent apps, few terrible apps, and many mediocre apps in between. A mediocre app does not properly integrate with the platform, work well in constrained environments, or handle faulty networks. When hiring an Android developer, the author looks for: solid software engineering skills like SOLID principles and clean code; competency in data structures, algorithms, and BigO notation; proficiency in Java; understanding of concurrency and distributed systems; problem solving skills; ability to describe their tech stack; communication skills; understanding of current tech context; motivation for mobile. The author would not worry if a candidate lacks Android SDK knowledge, as long as they have the core CS fundamentals. But it's ideal if they also understand Android architecture, the build process, app installation, Dalvik/ART VMs, IPC, sandboxing, permissions, etc. They should be deeply questioned on their areas of expertise. The emphasis should be on fundamental CS concepts rather than specific libraries. The ideal candidate has a sharp mind capable of analyzing problems thoroughly and developing custom solutions. But junior developers can also be valuable with proper senior oversight. The goal is to hire engineers, not just library users."

The article describes a computer vision system for realtime inspection of cookies on a production line. The system uses OpenCV, an open source computer vision library, along with a digital camera, lighting, and a computer. The system operates by first capturing an image of the production line. It then detects if a cookie is present using color detection. If a cookie is detected, the image is preprocessed by selecting the best color channel, applying a threshold to create a binary image, and removing noise. The processed binary image is then analyzed to inspect the geometry and validate the dimensions of the cookie. This is done by finding contours, approximating polygons, and checking if the cookie is convex with proper dimensions. The result of the inspection, pass or fail, is displayed on the screen. For an industrial application, the result could also trigger an output to reject defective cookies. The example uses basic materials to demonstrate an educational computer vision system. Industrial systems would use specialized cameras, lighting, and lenses for high speed and precision inspection."

The Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) approved a new networking standard called 802.3bz2016 this week. This standard allows for wired network speeds between 2.5 Gbps and 5 Gbps, which is faster than the common 1 Gbps networks. A key benefit is that special cables are not required to reach these speeds. With 802.3bz2016, speeds up to 2.5 Gbps can be achieved over Cat 5e cables, while the full 5 Gbps speed requires Cat 6 cables. This new standard was designed as a compromise between slower 1 Gbps networks and faster 10 Gigabit networks that need more expensive cabling. By using a lower bandwidth of 100200 MHz instead of 400 MHz, researchers developed a technology similar to 10GBASET that works over more common Cat 5e and Cat 6 cables. Currently most home networks have 1 Gbps capabilities, while WiFi can reach over 6 Gbps. With 802.3bz2016, wired home network speeds will more than double. This will significantly improve transfer of large files and access to network attached storage. However, router manufacturers will need to adopt the new standard before it becomes widespread."

The concept of HypothesisDriven Development (HDD) applies the scientific method of forming a hypothesis, testing it, and learning from the results to software and business development. HDD involves treating new product ideas as hypotheses to be tested through controlled experiments. Customer Discovery and Lean Startup methodologies can be used to test assumptions about target customers. Testdriven development also aligns with HDD, with tests formulated to validate programming. Ultimately, developing a product or service is a process of testing a hypothesis about how it will behave in the intended market. The main benefits of HDD are measurable evidence and continuous learning. By taking an experimental approach, we can quickly test proposed solutions against identified problems to build the right solutions effectively. For example, Sabre Holdings used HDD to test how customers' willingness to pay a premium for a hotel room varied by time of day the reservation was made. This increased their conversion rate 400% in one week. Combining HDD and continuous delivery accelerates innovation by amplifying validated knowledge. The ideal process is to identify random relationships between changes and their impacts through radical experimentation.

Ultrasonic distance sensors can be used to estimate the flow rate of a fluid reservoir as a low cost alternative to flow sensors. The sensor emits an ultrasonic pulse and measures the time for the echo to return, calculating distance based on the speed of sound. By measuring the change in distance to the fluid surface over time, the change in volume can be calculated based on the reservoir's cross sectional area. Dividing this volume change by the time interval gives the flow rate. This was demonstrated using an Arduino and HCSR04 ultrasonic sensor to measure the falling level of water in a cylindrical tank. The sensor readings were averaged to reduce noise. This provides a simple way to estimate fluid flow rates without direct fluid interaction.

It recommends starting simple with commands and introducing events as complexity increases. Microservices allow easy disposal of modules since each service is small and isolated, enabling fast delivery of new features. However, complexity is pushed outside service boundaries into the interaction between modules. Communication between services should follow agreed upon standards to avoid nightmarish complexity. Commands promote coupling between client and provider. The client needs a response from the provider, requiring it to wait and handle operation outcomes. Events refer to past occurrences, are immutable, and emitters are oblivious to listeners. Events allow decoupled, asynchronous communication. Use commands when the client needs the operation response to proceed, the operation is synchronous, or it's a simple query. Use events for commonly sought messages, when producers don't care about consumer processing, or as the architecture grows. Neither pattern is a silver bullet. Start simple with commands, then introduce events as complexity increases."

This enables continuous delivery and reduces complexity. Versioning APIs is challenging because breaking changes can break client applications. The traditional approach is to version the URL, like api.example.com/v1/resource. Nonbreaking changes are often released without notice, while breaking changes require extensive communication and planning. This leads to restrictive policies that hamper innovation. A better approach is to use content negotiation, an existing HTTP feature where the client and server negotiate the response format. Resources can express multiple representations based on their state. For APIs, this means specifying the exact data format in the response, not just JSON or XML. The version can be specified in a custom media type parameter. This allows versioning individual resources rather than the whole API. Benefits include no URI versioning, client updates only when used resources change, and continuous delivery. Challenges include routing responses in the app stack, clients knowing media types, and communicating changes. Solutions include MVC patterns, caching media types, and providing deprecation links in responses to outdated versions. Overall, content negotiation reduces complexity in API versioning with standardsbased REST principles. The media type is often overlooked but provides flexibility and agility for internal teams and usability for API consumers."

The article discusses the pros and cons of using orchestration vs reactive architecture patterns when building microservices. Orchestration involves a central controller that coordinates interactions between services. Benefits are centralized flow control and managing synchronous steps. Drawbacks are coupling services, single point of failure, and blocking requests. Reactive architecture uses an event stream for asynchronous communication between services. Benefits are parallel processing, easy to add/update services, and distributed control. Drawbacks are complexity in distributed flow logic and async programming. Hybrid approaches combine reactive and orchestration. One option is reactive between services and orchestration within a service. Another is reactive between services and a coordinator driving flow. Hybrids work well when there is a mix of sync and async needs. When to use orchestration: Mostly sequential steps, desire centralized flow control, decoupling not a priority. When to use reactive: Lots of parallel processing, decentralizing flow is feasible, speed important. Evaluate reactive first, then layer on orchestration as needed.

Dr Gideon Greenspan, founder and CEO of Coin Sciences, discusses why blockchainenabled smart contracts may be suffering from inflated expectations. He argues that while permissioned bitcoinstyle blockchains have proven use cases like provenance tracking and recordkeeping, equivalent use cases have yet to emerge for Ethereumstyle smart contracts. Greenspan outlines three common misconceptions about smart contracts: 1. Smart contracts cannot retrieve external data or contact external services on their own, as this would break consensus across blockchain nodes. Oracles must push external data onto the blockchain instead. 2. Smart contracts cannot guarantee onchain payments while still allowing issuers to productively use raised funds, as this eliminates risk. 3. Smart contracts cannot hide confidential data, as data is replicated across all nodes and easily viewable. According to Greenspan, smart contracts are only useful for blockchain use cases that can't be implemented with bitcoinstyle transaction constraints. So far, compelling permissioned blockchain applications can be implemented without smart contracts. However, new use cases may still emerge that require the flexibility of smart contracts."

The article discusses building a Facebook chatbot using Node.js and deploying it on Heroku. The bot allows users to get details about movies by querying the bot on Messenger. To build the bot, the author sets up a Node.js server that communicates with the Facebook Graph API to receive and respond to messages. The server is deployed on Heroku for public access. A Facebook app and page are created which will be associated with the bot. Webhooks are enabled so the bot can receive event updates from Facebook in real time. The bot handles different callback events like messages, postbacks and authentication. The bot uses the Open Movie Database API to fetch movie details. It first confirms the movie title with the user before providing further details like plot, cast, rating etc. User queries are saved in a MongoDB database hosted on mLab. The bot sends back structured messages to the user with text, images and buttons. It can understand certain keywords in the user's message to provide the appropriate movie detail. The author notes the bot is limited by its rulesbased approach. Integrating NLP services like wit.ai can make interactions more natural.

UX stands for \\\"user experience\\\" and focuses on providing high usability, efficiency, and satisfaction in user interactions. Experts shared the main UX trends they see for 2017: Chatbots will impact UX designers. Flows and interfaces for bots will need to be conversational and logical like human interactions. Conversational interfaces using AI like Alexa and Siri will grow. Storytelling approaches can make interactions more natural. Designers should start with templates then customize details for unique, enjoyable experiences. Some teams are hiring experts like psychologists to understand users. AI, augmented reality, voice recognition, and machine learning will likely expand after successes like Amazon Echo. UX is crucial for these innovations. Good usability will be a fundamental expectation, not a differentiator. Brand personalities and microinteractions will create differentiation. UX designers will work closely with customer success teams to ensure users achieve desired results. Data and testing will drive decisions instead of assumptions. Tools like Adobe XD will unify design, prototype, and code. Sustainability and social/environmental impact will become part of UX. Design choices should consider problems created in the world.

Since the early 2000s, the desktop metaphor of tabbed browsing has dominated web navigation. Mozilla Research's Browser.html project experiments with evolving tabs into trails to construct narratives of user activity. Trails aim to preserve entire browsing histories, unlike tabs which often lose context. For example, Nala's search for the perfect pizza opens successive tabs which sever connections to previous navigation. With trails, her entire path from search to restaurants remains intact in one view. Trails present complete lefttoright narratives. But complex trees can be distracting, so Browser.html focuses on one trail at a time while folding others. The result is a simplified view of Nala's sequential journey. Trails enhance tabs without replacing them. Opportunities include sharing full trails, fading old ones, revisiting saved trails, annotating research, and collaborative exploration. The trail concept originated with Vannevar Bush's 1945 Memex machine for sharing hyperlinked research trails. Recent projects like Xerox Trails and Trailblazer have continued this direction. Browser.html connects trails to familiar tabs, aiming to make the idea more accessible. The Browser.html project is building its first prototype and welcomes collaboration on GitHub and Slack."

DiffUtil is a utility class in Android that can calculate differences between two lists and output a list of update operations to convert the first list into the second. It can be used with RecyclerView adapters to efficiently update the UI when data changes. The typical way to update a RecyclerView is to call notifyDataSetChanged() on the adapter. But this is inefficient as it rebinds all views. DiffUtil solves this by only updating changed items. To use DiffUtil, you create a DiffUtil.Callback subclass and override methods to compare the old and new lists: getOldListSize()/getNewListSize() return sizes of old and new lists areItemsTheSame() checks if two items represent the same object areContentsTheSame() checks if items have the same data getChangePayload() returns a payload about the change You then call DiffUtil.calculateDiff() and dispatchUpdatesTo() on the RecyclerView adapter.

The Brazilian government plans to unveil a preliminary National Plan for \\\"Internet of Things\\\" at an upcoming mobile technology event in Barcelona. The plan aims to position Brazil at the forefront of connecting everyday objects to the internet. However, the plan is considered premature by industry experts since it will be presented just two months after the government hired consultants to research and develop the plan. The full study analyzing international best practices and defining Brazil's aspirations will take most of 2017 to complete. The preliminary plan in February will only provide general outlines about Brazil's intentions. While some are concerned the plan will try to develop a domestic hardware industry, experts believe Brazil should focus on software and services which offer more value. Overall the initiative is praised as a proactive policy, but many believe more industry consultation is needed before launching a detailed plan.

They see hybrid and interactive systems like AlphaGo as steps towards real intelligence. The article discusses two differing perspectives on artificial intelligence (AI) one optimistic and enthusiastic, the other more cautious and concerned. It notes that many technology enthusiasts naturally align with the optimistic view, but cautions against losing sight of the responsibilities and challenges that come with technological progress. The article then outlines the concept of \\\"Parallel Intelligence\\\" proposed by FeiYue Wang and colleagues at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. This inverts traditional AI, with complex laws guiding huge amounts of data rather than broad universal laws controlling small data. The example of AlphaGo beating the Go player Lee Sedol is used with AlphaGo playing over 30 million games and learning from each one. The authors argue this shows intelligence emerging from computation and interaction. The article states AI is in a phase of \\\"hybrid intelligence\\\" and needs to move to modeling changing possibilities, where X doesn't always cause Y. The authors propose an \\\"ACP Approach\\\" using artificial intelligence to generate data, computational experiments to find patterns, and parallel systems interacting with the physical world.

Consultants and crossfunctional growth sprints can help in the short term. The article discusses common issues that CEOs face when trying to grow their companies past the initial product/market fit stage. A key problem is that experiments and new campaigns take too long to launch due to dependencies on other teams. For example, the growth team may be blocked by the design team being delayed on a project. There are three main causes identified: goal misalignment across teams, overreliance on other teams, and political misunderstandings about roles. To address this, the article recommends some shortterm solutions like having a \\\"growth consultant\\\" educate the company or doing focused growth sprints with crossfunctional teams. Longerterm, there needs to be a mindset shift across the company to focus on the customer and speed of learning. This requires gradual experimentation with team structures.

GitLab experienced a major outage this week after discovering failures in its backup systems, resulting in potential data loss. On Tuesday, GitLab tweeted that it was taking its site offline for emergency database maintenance. It then revealed it had accidentally deleted production data and might need to restore from backup. However, none of its backup or replication systems were working properly: LVM snapshots were only taken every 24 hours, not more frequently. Regular backups also only occurred every 24 hours, and the location of these backups is unknown. The backup files produced were only a few bytes in size, suggesting the backups were failing. pg_dump was failing because the wrong PostgreSQL binary version was being used. No SQL dumps were made as a result. Older backups may have been deleted by the Fog gem. Disk snapshots were only enabled for the NFS server, not the database servers. Webhooks were deleted during the synchronization process to staging. Unless these can be restored from the last 24 hours, they will be lost. The replication process was fragile, errorprone, and poorly documented. Backups to S3 were also empty. This outage is particularly embarrassing as GitLab had recently moved from the cloud to its own Ceph infrastructure, claiming this would make them more efficient, consistent, and reliable. At the time of writing, GitLab has no estimated restore time but is trying to restore from a 6hour old staging server, which will mean some data loss.

Role models and teaching history of discrimination could help. The study published in Science suggests that girls as young as 6 can be led to believe men are inherently smarter and more talented than women, making girls less motivated to pursue novel activities or ambitious careers. At age 5, girls and boys associated brilliance with their own gender. But at 6 and 7, girls were significantly less likely to associate brilliance with women. When asked to pick children who look like they do well in school, girls still tended to pick girls, meaning their perceptions of brilliance are not based on academic performance. In the second part of the study, 6 and 7 year old boys still wanted to play a game described as for really smart kids, while girls opted for a game described as for kids who try really hard. As a result, believing they are not as gifted as boys, girls tend to shy away from demanding careers, leading to differences in aspirations between men and women. The stereotypes likely come from parents, teachers, peers, media, and exposure to famous male \\\"geniuses\\\" in history. Actions must be taken so these biases don't curtail girls' professional aspirations, such as exposing girls to successful women as role models. Companies like Mattel have tried reducing gender stereotypes through campaigns like \\\"You can be anything\\\" Barbie. Rebecca Bigler said explaining gender discrimination in history and children's potential to contribute to social justice could help them believe in their own intellectual potential."

This is useful for eventdriven microservices. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) is an architectural pattern that separates reads and writes into different models. It is commonly used in eventdriven architectures and microservices. In CQRS, the command side handles writes by exposing APIs that accept commands. Commands trigger actions which produce domain events that get persisted in an event store. The event processor listens to the event store and applies events to materialized views. The query side exposes APIs for reading the materialized views built from the events. The query side is readonly. A typical CQRS implementation has three components command side, query side, and event processor. This can resemble a distributed monolith if the components must be deployed together. Some argue CQRS deployments are complex compared to a single microservice focused on one thing. But each CQRS component can still be independently deployed to deliver features. So CQRS can still be considered a microservices architecture."

It enables IoT projects to leverage MQTT and Google Cloud. Agosto is a Google Cloud Premier Partner that has been building products and delivering services on Google Cloud Platform since 2012, including Internet of Things applications. Agosto evaluated several IoT platforms but found staying on Google Cloud Platform to be better than using a single IoT platform with costly licensing and closed practices. Agosto's clients like building scalable prototypes with Google's tools and architectures. One challenge was picking an efficient messaging protocol between devices and Google Cloud. After evaluating protocols, Agosto chose MQTT, which is lightweight, well documented, and widely used.

True retention measures whether a user exhibits a certain behavior within the natural time period they need the product. To calculate true retention: Identify the core problem your product solves Estimate how often users face that problem Count users who used your product when they faced that problem Divide by total users For example, Airbnb solves the problem of booking accommodations for trips. People take 1.4 trips per year on average. In 2015 Airbnb had 17 million bookings out of a potential 84 million trips by its 60 million users. So Airbnb's true retention rate was 17/84 = 20%.

This allows sites to identify users even when they switch browsers, breaking a key defense against browser fingerprinting. Browser fingerprints are based on specific settings and customizations in each browser installation. Until now, tracking was limited to a single browser, making it hard to tie fingerprints from different browsers to the same user.

The Tor browser provides protection, but tweaking it to enable certain WebGL features can make it vulnerable. The technique is lightweight enough to run in the background without notice. No sites are known to be using it yet. Other tracking methods include monitoring typing patterns and inaudible sounds. Running a browser in a virtual machine may help defend against fingerprinting."

The article discusses different patterns related to eventdriven systems that were identified at a ThoughtWorks summit: Event Notification When a system sends event messages to notify other systems of a change, without expecting a response. This implies low coupling but can obscure largerscale flows across events. EventCarried State Transfer Events contain state data so recipients don't need to query the source. Provides resilience and reduces latency, but more complexity in maintaining state. Event Sourcing System changes are stored as events, which can rebuild system state. Provides auditability and ability to explore histories. Issues include handling interactions and schema changes. CQRS Separate read and write models, often combined with events. Can simplify complex domains but adds complexity. The article notes it is easy to conflate these patterns. Proper guidelines are needed on when to use each one. The core problem is confusing the different patterns."

But sustaining gains requires leadership commitment and cultural change. Banks are looking to improve efficiency as they update their strategies to align with current market trends and legislation. The fastpaced and complex banking environment can lead to temporary workarounds instead of fixing root causes, which Lean principles could address. Lean originated in the 1940s from Toyota's production system, which revolutionized automobile manufacturing by switching from batch to singlepiece flow and removing waste to reduce costs. Lean principles have since spread beyond manufacturing to services. Every industry offers a product or service with an underlying process, so Lean principles apply even without manufacturing. For example, consider the current account opening process, which involves multiple departments to create value for the customer, but has associated costs. Banks use loss leader pricing, offering lowcost products like current accounts to acquire customers for more profitable offerings like loans. This highlights the need to lower costs of lowrevenue processes, enabling Lean in banking. Possible Lean optimizations for the example process: Replace inperson appointment with virtual meeting, removing travel needs and shortening lead time. Eliminate secondary check by branch manager by giving more authority to personal banker. This further reduces lead time so accounts open faster. Applying Lean drives continuous improvement, eliminates waste, adds value, and reduces costs via various tools and training. However, oneoff \\\"idle\\\" projects offer temporary gains. Sustaining improvement requires embedding Lean as an ongoing culture. Recommendations: 1) Engage leadership around strategy. 2) Map current processes to find waste. 3) Redesign processes. 4) Pilot and implement changes. 5) Continuously improve with Lean tools and techniques. Financial services are advancing technologically while adhering to new regulations requiring new ways of working. But behind every process lies potential savings from applying Lean principles. Making costcutting unconscious could provide major savings for banks."

Technical debt is an issue that many software teams face. Here are some ideas to help manage technical debt: Educate the team on technical debt through lunchandlearns and examples from your projects. Create a \\\"TechDebt\\\" category in your issue tracker to track specific artifacts that need improvement. Standardize on comment formats like \\\"Fix me\\\" to mark areas needing revision. Use static analysis tools to detect \\\"code smells\\\" and other issues. Prioritize fixing debt in frequently modified code first. Hold brainstorming sessions to identify past design decisions that have led to debt today. Estimate not just the cost to fix debt but also the cost of not fixing it in terms of reduced productivity or quality. Bring some technical debt items into each sprint/iteration backlog to pay it down constantly. Break down the TechDebt category into simple code issues and more structural/architectural debt. Identify root causes of major debt like schedule pressure, lack of process, etc. and address them. Use dependency analysis tools to detect structural issues. Develop regression testing to prevent new bugs when fixing debt. Consider including major debt items in your risk management process.

Using shapes instead and simplifying assets improves performance. Vector graphics allow images to be described mathematically and rendered smoothly at any resolution. Android began supporting vector graphics natively in API 21 using VectorDrawable XML resources. VectorDrawables can reduce APK size since only one asset is needed per image instead of multiple PNGs. However, VectorDrawables have computational overhead and take longer to render initially compared to PNGs. When a VectorDrawable is rendered, a bitmap cache is generated to optimize subsequent drawing. This cache is invalidated if the image size changes, like when rotating a device. So VectorDrawables that change size on rotation will render slowly each time. But a VectorDrawable with consistent size will render quickly after the initial draw. Google recommends VectorDrawable size be at most 200x200dp. Tests showed a fullscreen 1440x1960px VectorDrawable took 16ms to draw initially versus 0.18ms for a PNG. A 200x200dp VectorDrawable took 3.4ms versus 0.06ms for a PNG. Complex paths also increase VectorDrawable draw time. Consider using shapes instead of VectorDrawables when possible, as they render faster. Simplify complex VectorDrawables into multiple assets if needed. For very complex highresolution graphics, raster formats like WebP may be better than VectorDrawables to avoid performance impacts."
