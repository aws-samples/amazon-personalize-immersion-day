    "Now that Unicorn Post has trained models for 2 different use cases (User Personalization and Personalized Reranking), we need to integrate them into our application. Amazon Personalize can make recommendations available via an Application Programming Interface (API). In addition, Amazon Personalize includes features that allow you to easily integrate into applications and provide benefits like real time vending of recommendations based on recent application activity.\n",

      "Google extends Gmail API for more granular email settings management Google updated the Gmail API with new endpoints to manage filters, aliases, forwarding, signatures, vacation responders, and other granular email settings. This replaces the deprecated Email Settings API. Google has extended the Gmail API with new endpoints for managing email settings like filters, forwarding addresses, IMAP/POP settings, sendas aliases, signatures, and vacation responders. Developers can now retrieve and update signatures for sendas aliases, configure forwarding to external addresses, configure sendas aliases through external providers, use HTML in vacation messages, and manipulate settings for gmail.com accounts. More settings features like mailbox delegate support will be added over time. Most settings endpoints work for any Google Apps or Gmail account, but sensitive operations like modifying aliases or forwarding are restricted to service accounts with domainwide authority. The existing Email Settings API in the Admin SDK is deprecated and will be turned down on July 7, 2017 in favor of the updated Gmail API. Google has provided a migration guide to help clients transition.\n",

      "Google's Spanner database offers global replication and consistency Google is now offering its globally distributed Spanner database as a cloud service. The unique time synchronization could benefit global businesses. About a decade ago, Google engineers built a global database called Spanner that works across multiple data centers around the world. Spanner behaves as if it's in one place, allowing Google to replicate data and make changes globally without conflicts. This provides consistency across Google services like Gmail and AdWords. Spanner achieves this by using GPS receivers, atomic clocks, and time synchronization technology called TrueTime to establish a common time reference across data centers. This allows for coordination between distributed systems faster than the speed of light. TrueTime is unique to Google. Spanner gives Google a competitive advantage in cloud computing against rivals like Amazon and Microsoft. Google hopes Spanner's global replication and consistency will appeal to global businesses and financial institutions. A supply chain company called JDA is already testing Spanner. Spanner was previously only useful to Google, but now Google is offering it as a cloud service so other companies can benefit from its global scale and unique time synchronization abilities. This could allow businesses to more easily expand globally and replicate data across regions.\n",

      "Evernote migrates from own data centers to Google Cloud Evernote moved its popular note taking service to Google Cloud for machine learning capabilities, flexibility, and to avoid running its own infrastructure. Evernote decided last year to move away from running its own data centers and start using the public cloud to operate its popular notetaking service. It signed up to work with Google Cloud Platform. Google sent engineers to help Evernote with the migration. Evernote wanted to leverage the cloud for new machine learning features and flexibility. The migration required adapting Evernote's backend, which was built assuming onpremises data centers. Google's expertise in unstructured data and machine learning made it a good fit over AWS or Azure. The migration had to be done without losing any of Evernote's 3 petabytes of data or disrupting the live service. Evernote reworked parts of its application like networking and storage to work on Google's cloud. Google engineers provided 24/7 support and even came onsite to help. The main migration took around 10 days. The cloud removed Evernote's need to maintain its own data centers and keep up with infrastructure advances. It provides reduced latency for international users through Google's network. Evernote is still migrating some final user attachments but all data is now encrypted at rest. The company has more freedom to leverage cloud services for new features.\n",

      "Setting autoexpiry dates for Google Drive file sharing links A guide explains how to create temporary access links for Google Drive files that automatically expire after a chosen time period, using a thirdparty web app. The article explains how to set autoexpiry dates for shared Google Drive links. This allows you to share files that are only accessible for a limited time. While Google Drive allows setting expiration dates, this is only available for paid Google Workspace accounts. The article provides instructions for free Google account users to create temporary links that autoexpire after a chosen time period. The steps are: 1. Go to labnol.org/expire and authorize the web app to access your Google Drive. 2. Open the File Picker and select the file or folder to share. 3. Enter the email addresses of users to share with. Specify if they get viewer or editor access. 4. Set the time period after which access will be revoked. 5. Click \\\"Set Expiration\\\" and the access will be automatically removed after the set date/time. The article also mentions the Google Drive Auditor addon to analyze permissions on shared files. And the autoexpiry app lists files set to expire.\n",

      "Google consolidates Hangouts On Air into YouTube Live Google is retiring Hangouts On Air and moving livestreaming features to YouTube Live to consolidate products. Google announced that Google+ Hangouts On Air will no longer be available starting September 12. Users will be asked to use YouTube Live for livestreaming instead. Google first launched Hangouts On Air in 2011 for select users and opened it up to everyone in 2012. In 2013, Google launched YouTube Live and has now decided to consolidate the two products. After September 12, users won't be able to schedule new Hangouts On Air events. Existing events after this date will need to be moved to YouTube Live. Hangouts On Air will still exist in some form, just not tied to Google+. Users will need to use YouTube Live's builtin scheduling feature instead. To use Hangouts On Air with YouTube Live: Go to Live Streaming Events in Creator Studio, click New live event, select Quick (using Google Hangouts On Air), title the event, schedule it or go live now, and broadcast with Hangouts. Recorded events will still be on YouTube. The only Google+ link will be to see event content in readonly Activity Log. Google began dropping the Google+ requirement across products in 2015, a process still ongoing. Last week Google Play dropped the requirement for reviews. Next month, Hangouts On Air scheduling will move off Google+.\n",

This replaces the deprecated Email Settings API. Google has extended the Gmail API with new endpoints for managing email settings like filters, forwarding addresses, IMAP/POP settings, sendas aliases, signatures, and vacation responders. Developers can now retrieve and update signatures for sendas aliases, configure forwarding to external addresses, configure sendas aliases through external providers, use HTML in vacation messages, and manipulate settings for gmail.com accounts. More settings features like mailbox delegate support will be added over time. Most settings endpoints work for any Google Apps or Gmail account, but sensitive operations like modifying aliases or forwarding are restricted to service accounts with domainwide authority. The existing Email Settings API in the Admin SDK is deprecated and will be turned down on July 7, 2017 in favor of the updated Gmail API.

The unique time synchronization could benefit global businesses. About a decade ago, Google engineers built a global database called Spanner that works across multiple data centers around the world. Spanner behaves as if it's in one place, allowing Google to replicate data and make changes globally without conflicts. This provides consistency across Google services like Gmail and AdWords. Spanner achieves this by using GPS receivers, atomic clocks, and time synchronization technology called TrueTime to establish a common time reference across data centers. This allows for coordination between distributed systems faster than the speed of light. TrueTime is unique to Google. Spanner gives Google a competitive advantage in cloud computing against rivals like Amazon and Microsoft. Google hopes Spanner's global replication and consistency will appeal to global businesses and financial institutions. A supply chain company called JDA is already testing Spanner. Spanner was previously only useful to Google, but now Google is offering it as a cloud service so other companies can benefit from its global scale and unique time synchronization abilities. This could allow businesses to more easily expand globally and replicate data across regions.\"}},\n",

Evernote decided last year to move away from running its own data centers and start using the public cloud to operate its popular notetaking service. It signed up to work with Google Cloud Platform. Google sent engineers to help Evernote with the migration. Evernote wanted to leverage the cloud for new machine learning features and flexibility. The migration required adapting Evernote's backend, which was built assuming onpremises data centers. Google's expertise in unstructured data and machine learning made it a good fit over AWS or Azure. The migration had to be done without losing any of Evernote's 3 petabytes of data or disrupting the live service. Evernote reworked parts of its application like networking and storage to work on Google's cloud. Google engineers provided 24/7 support and even came onsite to help. The main migration took around 10 days. The cloud removed Evernote's need to maintain its own data centers and keep up with infrastructure advances. It provides reduced latency for international users through Google's network. Evernote is still migrating some final user attachments but all data is now encrypted at rest. The company has more freedom to leverage cloud services for new features.\"}},\n",

Google announced that Google+ Hangouts On Air will no longer be available starting September 12. Users will be asked to use YouTube Live for livestreaming instead. Google first launched Hangouts On Air in 2011 for select users and opened it up to everyone in 2012. In 2013, Google launched YouTube Live and has now decided to consolidate the two products. After September 12, users won't be able to schedule new Hangouts On Air events. Existing events after this date will need to be moved to YouTube Live. Hangouts On Air will still exist in some form, just not tied to Google+. Users will need to use YouTube Live's builtin scheduling feature instead. To use Hangouts On Air with YouTube Live: Go to Live Streaming Events in Creator Studio, click New live event, select Quick (using Google Hangouts On Air), title the event, schedule it or go live now, and broadcast with Hangouts.

It aims to help applications scale without sacrificing data consistency. Google has announced Cloud Spanner, a new globally distributed relational database service. Cloud Spanner combines the benefits of traditional relational databases like ACID transactions and SQL with the scalability of NoSQL databases. This allows developers to build applications that can scale horizontally without sacrificing data consistency. Cloud Spanner is a fully managed service that provides automatic scaling, high availability, and disaster recovery. It has a simple pricing model based on compute usage, storage, and network egress. Cloud Spanner supports standard relational database tools and languages like JDBC drivers and SQL queries. It is ideal for operational workloads like inventory management and financial transactions that are outgrowing traditional databases. Google has been developing the Spanner technology internally since 2007. It powers critical Google services like AdWords and Google Play, handling millions of queries per second. The research behind Spanner was published in 2012. Early adopters like Quizlet and JDA see Cloud Spanner as a compelling solution to scale their relational workloads beyond what sharding can achieve. It provides the performance of NoSQL with the consistency of a relational database.'}},\n",
