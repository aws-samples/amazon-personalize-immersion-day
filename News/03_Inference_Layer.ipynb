    "Now that Unicorn Post has trained models for 2 different use cases (User Personalization and Personalized Reranking), we need to integrate them into our application. Amazon Personalize can make recommendations available via an Application Programming Interface (API). In addition, Amazon Personalize includes features that allow you to easily integrate into applications and provide benefits like real time vending of recommendations based on recent application activity.\n",

      "Google extends Gmail API for more granular email settings management Google updated the Gmail API with new endpoints to manage filters, aliases, forwarding, signatures, vacation responders, and other granular email settings. This replaces the deprecated Email Settings API. Google has extended the Gmail API with new endpoints for managing email settings like filters, forwarding addresses, IMAP/POP settings, sendas aliases, signatures, and vacation responders. Developers can now retrieve and update signatures for sendas aliases, configure forwarding to external addresses, configure sendas aliases through external providers, use HTML in vacation messages, and manipulate settings for gmail.com accounts. More settings features like mailbox delegate support will be added over time. Most settings endpoints work for any Google Apps or Gmail account, but sensitive operations like modifying aliases or forwarding are restricted to service accounts with domainwide authority. The existing Email Settings API in the Admin SDK is deprecated and will be turned down on July 7, 2017 in favor of the updated Gmail API. Google has provided a migration guide to help clients transition.\n",

      "Career coach advises making a mind map to design an exciting new year Jenny Blake recommends creating a visual \\\"mind map\\\" to identify goals and next steps for a happier and more successful new year. Jenny Blake, a former Google career coach, advises making a \\\"mind map\\\" to design an exciting 2017. A mind map is a visual diagram of your interests and goals. To make one, write the year in the center of a paper and draw spokes for themes like business, health, and fun. Ask yourself what success in each area looks like. Connect the themes to specific ways to improve. Mind mapping sparks creativity by moving from linear to visual thinking. The goal is to identify possible next steps to make the new year happier and more successful. Blake shares this advice in her book \\\"Pivot: The Only Move That Matters Is Your Next One.\\\".\n",

      "Report finds banks lag in customer experience maturity and investment A global survey on customer experience in banking reveals most institutions lack a formal CX plan and focus more on internal metrics than customer ease. But CX investment is increasing. The report \\\"Improving Customer Experience in Banking\\\" shares results from a global survey on CX maturity in financial institutions. It finds most banks and credit unions are unprepared to meet rising consumer expectations. Digital transformation has enabled personalized, seamless engagement across channels. This increases potential for positive CX but also complexity. Unfortunately CX is not a top priority for many institutions, leading to transactional relationships. To improve CX and meet evolving needs, key priorities emerged: Shift digital focus from cost reduction to experience enhancement. Leverage analytics, machine learning, contextual engagement for personalization. Let customers engage how and when they want. Make advisory and sales proactive vs reactive. Engage throughout the customer journey. The report surveyed banks and credit unions on their CX maturity and provides a benchmark. It was sponsored by Deluxe Corp. Key findings: While all see CX as significant, it's less important at smaller institutions. Only 37% have a formal CX plan. CX objectives focus on internal benefits like sales and costs rather than customer simplicity and ease. Despite digital driving satisfaction, focus remains on products and branches over technology. Most will increase CX investment, especially over next 3 years. CX initiatives so far have had modest impact. Data analytics, legacy technology, customer view are top challenges. CX measurement lacks revenue impact metrics. The report concludes that as \\\"Age of the Individual\\\" emerges, using data and analytics to deliver personalized experiences will separate winners from losers. Banks should start by fixing one issue impeding customer satisfaction through a datadriven approach. The complete 85page report with survey data crosstabs is available for purchase.\n",

      "Cloud Native enables efficient, automated infrastructure through modular architecture Cloud Native is an approach to build modular, automated systems that can manage complexity and accelerate development. It utilizes practices like microservices, infrastructure as code, and CI/CD. Cloud Native is a way of structuring teams, culture, and technology to utilize automation and architectures to manage complexity and unlock velocity. The real value of Cloud Native goes beyond just the technologies associated with it. Cloud Native enables more efficient and happier teams by breaking large problems into smaller pieces and reducing manual work through automation. It leads to more reliable infrastructure and applications by building in automation to handle failures. Cloud Native also enables auditable, visible, and debuggable complex applications through the tools used to build them. It allows developers to create more secure applications through least trust principles. Finally, Cloud Native opens up algorithmic automation for more efficient use of resources like intelligent scheduling. We are still early in applying Cloud Native outside of technology companies, but it brings many benefits. Heptio is excited to help bring Cloud Native's advantages to the wider IT industry.\n",

      "Google search traffic hack by targeting \\\"best of year\\\" keywords Adding the current year to keywords can drive search traffic by targeting fresh annual results. But you need a monetization strategy like affiliate links. The article discusses how adding \\\"2016\\\" or \\\"2017\\\" to Google search queries can send huge amounts of traffic to websites. The author first got the idea when searching for \\\"best business books 2016\\\" and realized many people search with the current year to get the most recent results. He tested this on his own site by publishing an article with \\\"2016\\\" in the headline and got tens of thousands of visitors. Another example is the site 10beasts.com which was launched in 2016 with articles about the \\\"best\\\" products that year. Just 4 months after launch the site was getting 100k+ visitors per month and earning $4,687 in commissions. The site BestProducts.com also dominated Google in 2016 for yearbased terms, getting millions of visitors. To find profitable keywords, the author suggests using Google Trends, Google Keyword Planner, and reverseengineering sites like Amazon. Overall the tactic can drive huge organic search traffic if you target the right keywords, though you need a monetization strategy like affiliate marketing to profit. The key is finding \\\"longtail\\\" keywords with buyer intent that are less competitive. With some effort, the strategy provides a big SEO opportunity in 2017.\n",

      "IBM launches cloud graph database service using open source technologies IBM Graph provides developers an interactive graph database to learn Gremlin query language. It aims to make graph technology more accessible. IBM has launched a new cloudbased graph database service called IBM Graph, built on open source Titan and Apache TinkerPop technologies. The service is designed to make graph databases more accessible to developers by providing an interactive tutorial playground to help them learn Gremlin query language. The goal is to get developers up and running with graph technology quickly. IBM Graph provides up to 500MB of free storage and 25,000 free API calls per month. Additional storage and API calls are charged per GB and per 1000 calls. The service runs on IBM data centers on Cassandra for storage, Elasticsearch for indexing, and the open source Titan and TinkerPop technologies. IBM chose not to modify or fork these open source projects in order to maintain compatibility. IBM Graph is focused on transactional workloads by providing a secondary operational data store for realtime graph queries from other production applications. Analytic workloads are possible but not the main focus currently. Future plans include making it easier to load and model data for graphs, as modeling decisions are required upfront before loading data. IBM also aims to evolve the offering for analytic workloads like Apache Spark in the future.\n",

      "Google extends Gmail API for more granular email settings management Google updated the Gmail API with new endpoints to manage filters, aliases, forwarding, signatures, vacation responders, and other granular email settings. This replaces the deprecated Email Settings API. Google has extended the Gmail API with new endpoints for managing email settings like filters, forwarding addresses, IMAP/POP settings, sendas aliases, signatures, and vacation responders. Developers can now retrieve and update signatures for sendas aliases, configure forwarding to external addresses, configure sendas aliases through external providers, use HTML in vacation messages, and manipulate settings for gmail.com accounts. More settings features like mailbox delegate support will be added over time. Most settings endpoints work for any Google Apps or Gmail account, but sensitive operations like modifying aliases or forwarding are restricted to service accounts with domainwide authority. The existing Email Settings API in the Admin SDK is deprecated and will be turned down on July 7, 2017 in favor of the updated Gmail API. Google has provided a migration guide to help clients transition.\n",

      "Report finds banks lag in customer experience maturity and investment A global survey on customer experience in banking reveals most institutions lack a formal CX plan and focus more on internal metrics than customer ease. But CX investment is increasing. The report \\\"Improving Customer Experience in Banking\\\" shares results from a global survey on CX maturity in financial institutions. It finds most banks and credit unions are unprepared to meet rising consumer expectations. Digital transformation has enabled personalized, seamless engagement across channels. This increases potential for positive CX but also complexity. Unfortunately CX is not a top priority for many institutions, leading to transactional relationships. To improve CX and meet evolving needs, key priorities emerged: Shift digital focus from cost reduction to experience enhancement. Leverage analytics, machine learning, contextual engagement for personalization. Let customers engage how and when they want. Make advisory and sales proactive vs reactive. Engage throughout the customer journey. The report surveyed banks and credit unions on their CX maturity and provides a benchmark. It was sponsored by Deluxe Corp. Key findings: While all see CX as significant, it's less important at smaller institutions. Only 37% have a formal CX plan. CX objectives focus on internal benefits like sales and costs rather than customer simplicity and ease. Despite digital driving satisfaction, focus remains on products and branches over technology. Most will increase CX investment, especially over next 3 years. CX initiatives so far have had modest impact. Data analytics, legacy technology, customer view are top challenges. CX measurement lacks revenue impact metrics. The report concludes that as \\\"Age of the Individual\\\" emerges, using data and analytics to deliver personalized experiences will separate winners from losers. Banks should start by fixing one issue impeding customer satisfaction through a datadriven approach. The complete 85page report with survey data crosstabs is available for purchase.\n",
