    "To recap, we created a Domain dataset group, where you create preconfigured resources for different business domains and use cases, such as getting recommendations for similar videos (VIDEO_ON_DEMAND domain) or best selling items (ECOMMERCE domain). You choose your business domain, import your data, and create recommenders. You use recommenders in your application to get recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a [Domain dataset group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/domain-dataset-groups.html) if you have a video on demand or e-commerce application and want Amazon Personalize to find the best configurations for your use cases. If you start with a Domain dataset group, you can also add custom resources such as solutions with solution versions trained with recipes for custom use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "A [Custom dataset group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/custom-dataset-groups.html), where you create configurable resources for custom use cases and batch recommendation workflows. You choose a recipe, train a solution version (model), and deploy the solution version with a campaign. You use a campaign in your application to get recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a Custom dataset group if you don't have a video on demand or e-commerce application or want to configure and manage only custom resources, or want to get recommendations in a batch workflow. If you start with a Custom dataset group, you can't associate it with a domain later. Instead, create a new Domain dataset group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of the use case, the algorithms all share a base of learning on user-item-interaction data which is defined by 3 core attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **UserID** - The user who interacted\n",
    "1. **ItemID** - The item the user interacted with\n",
    "1. **Timestamp** - The time at which the interaction occurred\n",
    "\n",
    "We also support optional event types and event values defined by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Event Type** - Categorical label of an event (clicked, purchased, rated, listened, watched, etc).\n",
    "1. **Event Value** - A numeric value corresponding to the event type that occurred. This value can be used to filter interactions that are included in model training by specifying a minimum threshold. For example, suppose you have an event type of `Rated` and the value is the user rating on a scale of 0 to 5. Since Personalize models on positive interactions, you can use an event value threshold of, say, 3 to only include interactions with an event type of `Rated` that have an event value of 3 or higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "The event type and event value fields are additional data which can be used to filter the data sent for training the personalization model. In this particular exercise we dol not have an event value and will not be filtering the training data, i.e. we will use all available data for training (More information on how to use the eventValue with eventValueThreshold for Custom Domains in the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/recording-events.html)). \n",
    "\n",
    "### In this notebook we will accomplish the following:\n",

    "Create Video on Demand Domain Recommenders for the following use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [More like X](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/VIDEO_ON_DEMAND-use-cases.html#more-like-y-use-case): recommendations for movies that are similar to a movie that you specify.

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "3. [Personalized-Ranking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/working-with-predefined-recipes.html): will be used to rerank a list of movies.\n",

    "To run this notebook, you need to have run the previous notebook, `01_Data_Layer.ipynb`, where you created a dataset and imported interaction, item, and user metadata data into Amazon Personalize.

    "We recommend reading [the documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/working-with-training-metrics.html) to understand the metrics, but we have also copied parts of the documentation below for convenience.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to understand the following terms regarding evaluation in Personalize:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Relevant recommendation* refers to a recommendation that matches a value in the testing data for the particular user.\n",
    "* *Rank* refers to the position of a recommended item in the list of recommendations. Position 1 (the top of the list) is presumed to be the most relevant to the user.\n",
    "* *Query* refers to the internal equivalent of a GetRecommendations call.\n",
    "\n",
    "The metrics produced by Personalize are:\n",
    "* **coverage**: The proportion of unique recommended items from all queries out of the total number of unique items in the training data (includes both the Items and Interactions datasets).\n",
    "* **mean_reciprocal_rank_at_25**: The [mean of the reciprocal ranks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_reciprocal_rank) of the first relevant recommendation out of the top 25 recommendations over all queries. This metric is appropriate if you're interested in the single highest ranked recommendation.\n",
    "* **normalized_discounted_cumulative_gain_at_K**: Discounted gain assumes that recommendations lower on a list of recommendations are less relevant than higher recommendations. Therefore, each recommendation is discounted (given a lower weight) by a factor dependent on its position. To produce the [cumulative discounted gain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cumulative_gain) (DCG) at K, each relevant discounted recommendation in the top K recommendations is summed together. The normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) is the DCG divided by the ideal DCG such that NDCG is between 0 - 1. (The ideal DCG is where the top K recommendations are sorted by relevance.) Amazon Personalize uses a weighting factor of 1/log(1 + position), where the top of the list is position 1. This metric rewards relevant items that appear near the top of the list, because the top of a list usually draws more attention.\n",
    "* **precision_at_K**: The number of relevant recommendations out of the top K recommendations divided by K. This metric rewards precise recommendation of the relevant items.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "It is important to use evaluation metrics carefully. There are a number of factors to keep in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If there is an existing recommendation system in place, this will have influenced the user's interaction history which you use to train your new solutions. This means the evaluation metrics are biased to favor the existing solution. If you work to push the evaluation metrics to match or exceed the existing solution, you may just be pushing the User Personalization to behave like the existing solution and might not end up with something better.\n",
    "* The HRNN Coldstart recipe is difficult to evaluate using the metrics produced by Amazon Personalize. The aim of the recipe is to recommend items which are new to your business. Therefore, these items will not appear in the existing user transaction data which is used to compute the evaluation metrics. As a result, HRNN Coldstart will never appear to perform better than the other recipes, when compared on the evaluation metrics alone. Note: The User Personalization recipe also includes improved cold start functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping in mind these factors, the evaluation metrics produced by Personalize are generally useful for two cases:\n",
    "1. Comparing the performance of solution versions trained on the same recipe, but with different values for the hyperparameters and features (impression data etc)\n",
    "1. Comparing the performance of solution versions trained on different recipes (except HRNN Coldstart). Here also keep in mind that the recipes answer different use cases and comparing them to each other might not make sense in your solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Properly evaluating a recommendation system is always best done through A/B testing while measuring actual business outcomes. Since recommendations generated by a system usually influence the user behavior which it is based on, it is better to run small experiments and apply A/B testing for longer periods of time. Over time, the bias from the existing model will fade."
