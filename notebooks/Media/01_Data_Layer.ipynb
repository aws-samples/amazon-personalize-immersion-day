    "## Introduction <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"intro\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithms in Amazon Personalize (called recipes) look to solve different personalization use cases, explained here:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User Personalization** - predicts the items that a user will interact with based on Interactions, Items, and Users datasets. If you are building a recommendation system that provides personalized recommendations for each of your users, you should train your model with a User Personalization recipe\n",
    "    - User-Personalization - The `aws-user-personalization` recipe is optimized for all personalized recommendation scenarios. It predicts the items that a user will interact with based on Interactions, Items, and Users datasets. When recommending items, it uses automatic item exploration.\n",
    "    - Popularity-Count - The `aws-popularity-count` recipe recommends the most popular item items based on all of your user behavioral data. The most popular items have the most interactions with unique users. The recipe returns the same popular items for all users.\n",
    "    - Legacy recipes - The functionality in the legacy `aws-hrnn`, `aws-hrnn-coldstart`, and `aws-hrnn-metadata` recipes has been unified and improved in the `aws-user-personalization` recipe. Therefore, it is recommended to use the `aws-user-personalization` recipe rather than the HRNN recipes.\n",
    "- **Personalized Ranking** - provides recommendations in ranked order based on predicted interest level.\n",
    "    - Personalized-Ranking - the `aws-personalized-ranking` recipe generates personalized rankings of items. A personalized ranking is a list of recommended items that are re-ranked for a specific user. This is useful if you have a collection of ordered items, such as search results, promotions, or curated lists, and you want to provide a personalized re-ranking for each of your users.\n",
    "- **Related Items** - recipes that return items similar to an item that you specify when you get recommendations\n",
    "    - Similar-Items - the `aws-similar-items` recipe generates recommendations for items that are similar to an item you specify. Similarity is calculated based on both interactions data and item metadata. Use Similar-Items when you have a catalog that includes many new items with item metadata but little to no interactions data.\n",
    "    - SIMS - the `aws-sims` recipe, or item-to-item similarities (SIMS) recipe, generates items similar to a given item based on the co-occurrence of the item in user history in your Interactions dataset. If sufficient user behavior data for an item isn't available, or if the specified item ID isn't found, the recipe returns popular items as recommendations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of the use case, the algorithms all share a base of learning on user-item-interaction data which is defined by 3 core attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **UserID** - The user who interacted\n",
    "1. **ItemID** - The item the user interacted with\n",
    "1. **Timestamp** - The time at which the interaction occurred\n",
    "\n",
    "We also support optional event types and event values defined by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Event Type** - Categorical label of an event (clicked, purchased, rated, listened, watched, etc).\n",
    "1. **Event Value** - A numeric value corresponding to the event type that occurred. This value can be used to filter interactions that are included in model training by specifying a minimum threshold. For example, suppose you have an event type of `Rated` and the value is the user rating on a scale of 0 to 5. Since Personalize models on positive interactions, you can use an event value threshold of, say, 3 to only include interactions with an event type of `Rated` that have an event value of 3 or higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "The event type and event value fields are additional data which can be used to filter the data sent for training the personalization model. In this particular exercise we will not have an event type or event value (More information on how to use the eventValue with eventValueThreshold in the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/recording-events.html)). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Choose a dataset or data source <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"source\"></a>\n",
    "[Back to top](#top)\n",
    "\n",
    "As we mentioned, the user-item-iteraction data is key for getting started with the service. This means we need to look for use cases that generate that kind of data, a few common examples are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Video-on-demand applications\n",
    "1. E-commerce platforms\n",
    "1. Social media aggregators / platforms\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few guidelines for scoping a problem suitable for Personalize. We recommend the values below as a starting point, although the [official limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/limits.html) lie a little lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Authenticated users\n",
    "* At least 50 unique users\n",
    "* At least 100 unique items\n",
    "* At least 2 dozen interactions for each user \n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time this is easily attainable, and if you are low in one category, you can often make up for it by having a larger number in another category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking your data will not arrive in a perfect form for Personalize, and will take some modification to be structured correctly. This notebook guides you through all of that. \n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, we are going to use the latest MovieLens dataset, this dataset has over 25 million interactions and a rich collection of metadata for items. There is also a smaller version of this dataset, which can be used to shorten training times, while still incorporating the same capabilities as the full dataset. Set USE_FULL_MOVIELENS to True to use the full dataset."
