Static filters are where the filter properties are built into the filter itself, which makes invocation simpler, but gives less flexibility. An example of this would be a \"Horror\" movie filter, which invokes the get_recommendations_response api with the specific filter of GENRE = Horror. In order to create a recommendation for each filter that would require 10+ filters. Personalize also supports dynamic filters, where the values can be passed at runtime, allowing for a single filter of GENRE, where the actual genre is passed at runtime. \n",

    "\n",
    "Range based filters based on Item Metadata - Personalize supports range operations in both static and dynamic filters. Filtering based on a range can be used to create recommendations such as \"Whats on now\" in live tv scenarios, best of decade, Movies rated over 8/10 stars etc\n",
