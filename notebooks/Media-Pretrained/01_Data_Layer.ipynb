    "In Amazon Personalize, you start by creating a dataset group, which is a container for Amazon Personalize components. Your dataset group can be one of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "A Domain dataset group, where you create preconfigured resources for different business domains and use cases, such as getting recommendations for similar videos (VIDEO_ON_DEMAND domain) or best selling items (ECOMMERCE domain). You choose your business domain, import your data, and create recommenders. You use recommenders in your application to get recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a [Domain dataset group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/domain-dataset-groups.html) if you have a video on demand or e-commerce application and want Amazon Personalize to find the best configurations for your use cases. If you start with a Domain dataset group, you can also add custom resources such as solutions with solution versions trained with recipes for custom use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "A [Custom dataset group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/custom-dataset-groups.html), where you create configurable resources for custom use cases and batch recommendation workflows. You choose a recipe, train a solution version (model), and deploy the solution version with a campaign. You use a campaign in your application to get recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a Custom dataset group if you don't have a video on demand or e-commerce application or want to configure and manage only custom resources, or want to get recommendations in a batch workflow. If you start with a Custom dataset group, you can't associate it with a domain later. Instead, create a new Domain dataset group.\n",
    "\n",

    "* Authenticated users\n",
    "* At least 50 unique users\n",

    "1. Video-on-demand applications\n",
    "1. E-commerce platforms\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining your use-case will inform what data and what type of data you need.\n",

    "1. Amazon Personalize VIDEO_ON_DEMAND Domain recommender for the [\"More Like X\"](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/VIDEO_ON_DEMAND-use-cases.html#more-like-y-use-case) use case.\n",

    "1. **UserID** - The user who interacted\n",
    "1. **ItemID** - The item the user interacted with\n",
    "1. **Timestamp** - The time at which the interaction occurred\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, we are going to use the latest MovieLens dataset, this dataset has over 25 million interactions and a rich collection of metadata for items. There is also a smaller version of this dataset, which can be used to shorten training times, while still incorporating the same capabilities as the full dataset.\n",
