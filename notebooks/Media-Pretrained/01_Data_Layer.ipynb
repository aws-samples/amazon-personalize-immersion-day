    "# Welcome to UnicornFlix!\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You have just been hired by UnicornFlix, which is a new Direct to Consumer Streaming service that launched and is jumping into the crowded space of Video on Demand/Free Ad Supported TV (FAST) providers. You have been hired into the Search & Discovery team which leads efforts around personalization. Currently most of your app does not provide a personalized experience, the movies are presented in a static order for all users. In order to prevent customer churn, you are looking to add personalized experiences. \n",
    "\n",
    "You’ve been asked by the founders to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Increase subscriber engagement by tailoring every experience to individual users\n",
    "- Help users discover newly released content\n",
    "- Increase the breadth of content offered to them from the UnicornFlix catalog\n",
    "- Reduce the time to value by creating valuable recommendations in a short time\n",
