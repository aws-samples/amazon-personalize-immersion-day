    "In the previous notebook we prepared 3 different datasets that represent sample data that would exist in a Media & Entertainment applicatiopn (User interactions, Media catalog data and subscriber/user data). In order to complete this workshoop within the time set, we have already created several resources on your behalf. If you would like to create these yourself, run through notebook `04_Optional_Import_and_Training.ipynb`. This notebook will add approximately 80 minutes to the workshop. Here is an overview of what resources were created on your behalf. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Domain dataset group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/domain-dataset-groups.html) if you have a video on demand or e-commerce application and want Amazon Personalize to find the best configurations for your use cases. If you start with a Domain dataset group, you can also add custom resources such as solutions with solution versions trained with recipes for custom use cases. We created a Domain dataset group which is the location where the 3 datasets were imported.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Interactions Data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/interactions-datasets.html) The Interactions dataset is the core dataset that Amazon Personalize uses to provide recommendations. In Media & Entertainment use cases, this data is usually imported from a system that has data about the ways customers interact with media assets. Often this is sourced from Customer Data Platforms (CDP) or Analytics tools. For this lab we are simulating customer interaction data using the MovieLens dataset (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). \n",
    "\n",
    "We imported a dataset with the following fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **UserID** - The user who interacted\n",
    "1. **ItemID** - The item the user interacted with\n",
    "1. **Timestamp** - The time at which the interaction occurred\n",
    "1. **Event Type** - Categorical label of an event (clicked or watched).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This is just a subset of the data that can be sent in to provide/improve recommendations, we are not showing additional Amazon Personalize features for contextual receommendations, modeling on impression data etc. For full information see the documentation linked above.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[Item Metadata](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/items-datasets.html) he item data that you can import into Amazon Personalize includes numerical and categorical metadata such as creation timestamp, price, genre, description, and availability. You import metadata about your items into an Amazon Personalize Items dataset. Some domains and recipes require an Items dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Insert IMDB Data descriptoin\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[User Metadata](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/users-datasets.html) The user data that you can import into Amazon Personalize includes numerical and categorical metadata about your users, such as gender or loyalty membership. Since we do not have user data for the users in the Movielens data set, we are generating a synthetic dataset for the purposes of this workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **UserID** - The user who interacted\n",
    "1. **Membershiplevel** - A randomly assigned membership level\n",
    "\n",
    "### In this notebook we will accomplish the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create Video on Demand Domain Recommenders for the following use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [More like X](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/VIDEO_ON_DEMAND-use-cases.html#more-like-y-use-case): recommendations for movies that are similar to a movie that you specify. With this use case, Amazon Personalize automatically filters movies the user watched based on the userId that you specify and Watch events.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Top picks for you](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/VIDEO_ON_DEMAND-use-cases.html#top-picks-use-case): personalized content recommendations for a user that you specify. With this use case, Amazon Personalize automatically filters videos the user watched based on the userId that you specify and Watch events.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. [Personalized-Ranking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/working-with-predefined-recipes.html): will be used to rerank a list of movies.\n",

    "![Workflow](images/image2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this notebook, you need to have run the previous notebook, `01_Data_Layer.ipynb`, where you created a dataset and imported interaction, item, and user metadata data into Amazon Personalize. At the end of that notebook, you saved some of the variable values, which you now need to load into this notebook."

    "* *Relevant recommendation* refers to a recommendation that matches a value in the testing data for the particular user.\n",

    "* **coverage**: The proportion of unique recommended items from all queries out of the total number of unique items in the training data (includes both the Items and Interactions datasets).\n",
    "* **mean_reciprocal_rank_at_25**: The [mean of the reciprocal ranks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_reciprocal_rank) of the first relevant recommendation out of the top 25 recommendations over all queries. This metric is appropriate if you're interested in the single highest ranked recommendation.\n",
    "* **normalized_discounted_cumulative_gain_at_K**: Discounted gain assumes that recommendations lower on a list of recommendations are less relevant than higher recommendations. Therefore, each recommendation is discounted (given a lower weight) by a factor dependent on its position. To produce the [cumulative discounted gain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cumulative_gain) (DCG) at K, each relevant discounted recommendation in the top K recommendations is summed together. The normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) is the DCG divided by the ideal DCG such that NDCG is between 0 - 1. (The ideal DCG is where the top K recommendations are sorted by relevance.) Amazon Personalize uses a weighting factor of 1/log(1 + position), where the top of the list is position 1. This metric rewards relevant items that appear near the top of the list, because the top of a list usually draws more attention.\n",
    "* **precision_at_K**: The number of relevant recommendations out of the top K recommendations divided by K. This metric rewards precise recommendation of the relevant items.\n",

This means the evaluation metrics are biased to favor the existing solution. If you work to push the evaluation metrics to match or exceed the existing solution, you may just be pushing the User Personalization to behave like the existing solution and might not end up with something better.\n",

    "1. Comparing the performance of solution versions trained on different recipes. Here also keep in mind that the recipes answer different use cases and comparing them to each other might not make sense in your solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Properly evaluating a recommendation system is always best done through A/B testing while measuring actual business outcomes. Since recommendations generated by a system usually influence the user behavior which it is based on, it is better to run small experiments and apply A/B testing for longer periods of time. Over time, the bias from the existing model will fade."
