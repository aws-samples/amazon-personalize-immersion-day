This replaces the deprecated Email Settings API. Google has extended the Gmail API with new endpoints for managing email settings like filters, forwarding addresses, IMAP/POP settings, sendas aliases, signatures, and vacation responders. Developers can now retrieve and update signatures for sendas aliases, configure forwarding to external addresses, configure sendas aliases through external providers, use HTML in vacation messages, and manipulate settings for gmail.com accounts. More settings features like mailbox delegate support will be added over time. Most settings endpoints work for any Google Apps or Gmail account, but sensitive operations like modifying aliases or forwarding are restricted to service accounts with domainwide authority. The existing Email Settings API in the Admin SDK is deprecated and will be turned down on July 7, 2017 in favor of the updated Gmail API. Google has provided a migration guide to help clients transition.'}  \n",

This allows you to share files that are only accessible for a limited time. While Google Drive allows setting expiration dates, this is only available for paid Google Workspace accounts. The article provides instructions for free Google account users to create temporary links that autoexpire after a chosen time period. The steps are: 1. Go to labnol.org/expire and authorize the web app to access your Google Drive. 2. Open the File Picker and select the file or folder to share. 3. Enter the email addresses of users to share with. Specify if they get viewer or editor access. 4. Set the time period after which access will be revoked. 5. Click \\\"Set Expiration\\\" and the access will be automatically removed after the set date/time. The article also mentions the Google Drive Auditor addon to analyze permissions on shared files. And the autoexpiry app lists files set to expire.'}  \n",

Automated builds are popular but don't allow running dynamic code during the build process. This makes it difficult to generate useful labels like org.labelschema.builddate and org.labelschema.vcsref. Build hooks allow running scripts that can build and tag the image. An example build hook is provided that generates these labels. The hook shows it's possible to have useful dynamic labels with automated builds. The article also provides statistics on usage of automated builds 26% of public Docker Hub images use them, accounting for 32% of pulls. Finally it demonstrates the labels on a sample image built this way on Docker Hub and MicroBadger.'}  \n",

Users can add a goal like \\\"Work out more\\\" and answer questions about frequency and preferred times. Calendar will then analyze the user's schedule to find windows to schedule the goal. Goals have the same privacy settings as the default calendar. Calendar can automatically reschedule goals if events conflict and users can defer goals to make time later. Calendar gets better at scheduling goals over time based on edits and deferrals. Users can set their first goal by downloading the Google Calendar app on Android or iPhone. Currently goals do not account for secondary or synced calendars. The feature is launching fully over 13 days on both Rapid and Scheduled release tracks. Google suggests change management and provides Help Center articles on Goals. The latest Calendar apps can be downloaded from Google Play and the App Store. The feature launches for all Google Apps editions unless noted.'}  "

Last year, an article shared a tactic that could send websites thousands of visitors from Google by including the current year (e.g. \\\"2016\\\") in titles and content. The tactic worked, sending one website over 33,000 visitors from Google for a single article. The core idea is that people frequently add the current year to their Google searches to get the latest results (e.g. \\\"best business books 2016\\\"). Google Trends data confirms this behavior across many topics. Several success stories validate the approach: A new site called 10beasts.com focused entirely on \\\"best products of 2016\\\" lists. Within 4 months, it ranked #1 for hot product terms and made $4,687 from Amazon affiliates in one month. By December, it generated over $80,000 in profit. BestProducts.com, backed by Hearst Media's authority links, dominated Google for 2016 product queries and grew traffic from 2.5 million to 7.5 million visitors in 5 months. To capitalize on this for 2017, thorough keyword research is needed across tools like Google Trends, Keyword Planner, and by reverse engineering competitors' traffic.

The article introduces the concept of Cloud Native, which aims to bring benefits like efficient teams, reliable systems, better visibility, enhanced security, and efficient resource usage to companies beyond just tech giants. Cloud Native is an approach to structuring teams, culture, and technology to leverage automation and architectures that manage complexity and enable velocity. It's about scaling both the people and technology sides of the equation. Key benefits include more efficient and happier teams, reliable infrastructure and applications, better visibility and debuggability, enhanced security, and efficient resource usage. While initially proven at tech giants like Google, Netflix, and Facebook, Cloud Native techniques are now being adopted by smaller, agile companies too. However, there are still few examples outside of the technology early adopters. The authors, with their experience at Google, are excited to help bring Cloud Native benefits to the wider IT industry. Future articles will cover integrating with existing systems, DevOps, containers, orchestration, microservices, and security. The goal is to make companies, teams, and people more successful by applying these modern approaches.</td>\n",

The article introduces the concept of Cloud Native, which aims to bring benefits like efficient teams, reliable systems, better visibility, enhanced security, and efficient resource usage to companies beyond just tech giants. Cloud Native is an approach to structuring teams, culture, and technology to leverage automation and architectures that manage complexity and enable velocity. It's about scaling both the people and technology sides of the equation. Key benefits include more efficient and happier teams, reliable infrastructure and applications, better visibility and debuggability, enhanced security, and efficient resource usage. While initially proven at tech giants like Google, Netflix, and Facebook, Cloud Native techniques are now being adopted by smaller, agile companies too. However, there are still few examples outside of the technology early adopters. The authors, with their experience at Google, are excited to help bring Cloud Native benefits to the wider IT industry. Future articles will cover integrating with existing systems, DevOps, containers, orchestration, microservices, and security. The goal is to make companies, teams, and people more successful by applying these modern approaches.  "

The author explains a lesson learned from a previous project building microservices to extend a legacy retail banking platform. Despite delivering features quickly with the microservices approach, they tightly coupled the new microservices to the legacy system's large shared database due to infrastructure limitations. This tight coupling caused a 7 month delay in releasing the first microservice to production over concerns of impacting millions of users. The key lesson was that a new microservice should encapsulate both the unit of service and unit of failure from day one of development. This principle, based on Jim Gray's ideas on fault tolerance, avoids the risk of one microservice failure propagating beyond its module.

The Boulevard Shopping mall in Belo Horizonte, Brazil is partnering with startup BeGreen to open the city's first Urban Farm in March 2017. The 2,700 sq m farm will include a 1,500 sq m greenhouse capable of producing 50,000 heads of lettuce and herbs per month. The space will also have a farmtotable restaurant using the produce, a store selling the cultivated products, and an event space promoting sustainable living. The farm will use organic waste from the mall's food court as compost and will be selfsufficient in electricity. The goal is to demonstrate the viability of sustainable local food production that reduces waste and environmental impact. The farm addresses the issue that 80% of Brazil's produce is wasted due to long supply chains from farm to consumer. The onsite farm eliminates transportation and intermediaries so food reaches consumers faster. The construction utilizes reused shipping containers and other recycled materials. The project aims to provide fair trade for local producers who can also sell at the farm's store. It will offer public tours and training to promote the concept of urban agriculture.'}</td>\n",

The Boulevard Shopping mall in Belo Horizonte, Brazil is partnering with startup BeGreen to open the city's first Urban Farm in March 2017. The 2,700 sq m farm will include a 1,500 sq m greenhouse capable of producing 50,000 heads of lettuce and herbs per month. The space will also have a farmtotable restaurant using the produce, a store selling the cultivated products, and an event space promoting sustainable living. The farm will use organic waste from the mall's food court as compost and will be selfsufficient in electricity. The goal is to demonstrate the viability of sustainable local food production that reduces waste and environmental impact. The farm addresses the issue that 80% of Brazil's produce is wasted due to long supply chains from farm to consumer. The onsite farm eliminates transportation and intermediaries so food reaches consumers faster. The construction utilizes reused shipping containers and other recycled materials. The project aims to provide fair trade for local producers who can also sell at the farm's store. It will offer public tours and training to promote the concept of urban agriculture.'}  "

Node.js is a fast growing platform used by many startups and enterprises. It acts as a new tier that connects legacy systems with new technologies. The benefits of Node.js include enabling faster development and deployment. However, its speed introduces challenges for operations and performance teams who focus on availability and performance. Some common Node.js problems these teams face include: 1. Memory leaks Node.js is prone to memory leaks which cause crashes. Heap dumps can help track down the cause. 2. CPU problems Node.js runs singlethreaded so CPUheavy operations can block requests. CPU sampling can identify where time is being spent. 3. Back pressure Slow backends can cause congestion in Node.js. Monitoring intertier communication can identify the root cause. 4. Security Node.js relies heavily on third party modules which can contain vulnerabilities. Scanning for issues and using a private module repository can help. Node.js provides hooks for monitoring and debugging to help diagnose issues. The community is also actively improving tracing and debugging capabilities. With proper monitoring and diagnostics, operations teams can smoothly transition to using Node.js.'}</td>\n",

Wes McKinney and Hadley Wickham met in January to discuss improving interoperability between Python, R, and external systems. They noticed Python pandas dataframes and R dataframes have similar semantic models but different internal memory representations. Around this time Apache Arrow was started to improve data interoperability for columnar tabular data. They decided to use insights from feather to make a fast file format called Feather for storing dataframes usable by both Python and R. Feather is a fast, lightweight binary file format for storing dataframes with goals of simplicity, language agnosticism, and high read/write performance. The Feather API makes reading/writing dataframes easy. Feather is extremely fast, achieving over 600 MB/s write performance on SSDs. Feather can be installed from GitHub for R and PyPI for Python. It is not designed for longterm storage but for exchanging data between Python and R. Feather brings benefits of the Arrow spec to users through efficient languageagnostic tabular data representation. It uses Flatbuffers to serialize column metadata in a languageindependent way.

Allinone solutions like Sensedia provide deployment and management. Microservices architecture has become popular for building scalable and modular applications by decomposing them into independent services. However, integrating microservices with legacy systems that don't have standard interfaces like REST APIs can be challenging. The common solution is to build an adapter or integration layer to expose the legacy system's functionality as a RESTful microservice. These adapters should follow best practices like being lightweight, scalable, and using common standards like Swagger. Popular Java frameworks like Spring Boot and Apache Camel are good choices. Once built, microservices should be deployed to a PaaS like Cloud Foundry, OpenShift or Heroku for containerization, orchestration, monitoring, etc. This provides scalability and automation. Exposed microservices should then be managed by an API Management platform. This provides security, access control, caching, analytics and more. Sensedia API Management Suite offers integrated microservice deployment through its BaaS feature as well as full API management capabilities. This endtoend solution avoids needing separate infrastructure for running microservices. In summary, microservices enable REST APIs for legacy systems. Choosing the right frameworks and platforms is key. Allinone solutions like Sensedia provide microservice deployment and management alongside API management for an optimal approach.'}</td>\n",

This let them continuously deliver features through independent teams. Back in 2008, Netflix started their journey to microservices and the cloud for three reasons: availability, scale, and speed. As a 24x7 service, Netflix needs to always be online, but their monolithic codebase made troubleshooting difficult. The company also faced scaling challenges that were hard to address within a single application. Finally, Netflix needed to optimize for speed and agility in a competitive market. Microservices have many individual components, each with a specific responsibility, loosely coupled to each other. Services interact through contracts or messaging, with zero knowledge about implementation details. Microservices also encourage small teams to build and deploy focused services independently and continuously through automation. This is a major shift from monolithic systems built by large teams. Monoliths have interconnected components, making updates risky. Microservices allow fast, incremental changes without fragile dependencies. As an early adopter, Netflix solved complex problems with microservices and shared lessons through open source software. Anyone can now use tools like Spring Cloud to build cloudscale systems with Netflix components. Microservices enable continuous delivery of business value through independent teams and automation.'}</td>\n",

Allinone solutions like Sensedia provide deployment and management. Microservices architecture has become popular for building scalable and modular applications by decomposing them into independent services. However, integrating microservices with legacy systems that don't have standard interfaces like REST APIs can be challenging. The common solution is to build an adapter or integration layer to expose the legacy system's functionality as a RESTful microservice. These adapters should follow best practices like being lightweight, scalable, and using common standards like Swagger. Popular Java frameworks like Spring Boot and Apache Camel are good choices. Once built, microservices should be deployed to a PaaS like Cloud Foundry, OpenShift or Heroku for containerization, orchestration, monitoring, etc. This provides scalability and automation. Exposed microservices should then be managed by an API Management platform. This provides security, access control, caching, analytics and more. Sensedia API Management Suite offers integrated microservice deployment through its BaaS feature as well as full API management capabilities. This endtoend solution avoids needing separate infrastructure for running microservices. In summary, microservices enable REST APIs for legacy systems.

This let them continuously deliver features through independent teams. Back in 2008, Netflix started their journey to microservices and the cloud for three reasons: availability, scale, and speed. As a 24x7 service, Netflix needs to always be online, but their monolithic codebase made troubleshooting difficult. The company also faced scaling challenges that were hard to address within a single application. Finally, Netflix needed to optimize for speed and agility in a competitive market. Microservices have many individual components, each with a specific responsibility, loosely coupled to each other. Services interact through contracts or messaging, with zero knowledge about implementation details. Microservices also encourage small teams to build and deploy focused services independently and continuously through automation. This is a major shift from monolithic systems built by large teams. Monoliths have interconnected components, making updates risky. Microservices allow fast, incremental changes without fragile dependencies. As an early adopter, Netflix solved complex problems with microservices and shared lessons through open source software. Anyone can now use tools like Spring Cloud to build cloudscale systems with Netflix components. Microservices enable continuous delivery of business value through independent teams and automation.'}  "

This change would negatively impact all credit card companies, but especially smaller ones like Nubank that don't have the capital reserves of large banks. Nubank cofounder Cristina Junqueira criticized the idea, saying the current 30 day period allows time for the customer to pay their credit card bill, the issuer to receive the funds, and the purchaser to pay the retailer. She says reducing to 2 days would force Nubank to pay purchasers before even receiving customer payments. Simulations show that even 15 days would require Nubank to raise almost $1 billion in capital immediately to survive.

Allinone solutions like Sensedia provide deployment and management. Microservices architecture has become popular for building scalable and modular applications by decomposing them into independent services. However, integrating microservices with legacy systems that don't have standard interfaces like REST APIs can be challenging. The common solution is to build an adapter or integration layer to expose the legacy system's functionality as a RESTful microservice. These adapters should follow best practices like being lightweight, scalable, and using common standards like Swagger. Popular Java frameworks like Spring Boot and Apache Camel are good choices. Once built, microservices should be deployed to a PaaS like Cloud Foundry, OpenShift or Heroku for containerization, orchestration, monitoring, etc. This provides scalability and automation. Exposed microservices should then be managed by an API Management platform. This provides security, access control, caching, analytics and more. Sensedia API Management Suite offers integrated microservice deployment through its BaaS feature as well as full API management capabilities. This endtoend solution avoids needing separate infrastructure for running microservices. In summary, microservices enable REST APIs for legacy systems. Choosing the right frameworks and platforms is key. Allinone solutions like Sensedia provide microservice deployment and management alongside API management for an optimal approach.'}  \n",

Node.js is a fast growing platform used by many startups and enterprises. It acts as a new tier that connects legacy systems with new technologies. The benefits of Node.js include enabling faster development and deployment. However, its speed introduces challenges for operations and performance teams who focus on availability and performance. Some common Node.js problems these teams face include: 1. Memory leaks Node.js is prone to memory leaks which cause crashes. Heap dumps can help track down the cause. 2. CPU problems Node.js runs singlethreaded so CPUheavy operations can block requests. CPU sampling can identify where time is being spent. 3. Back pressure Slow backends can cause congestion in Node.js. Monitoring intertier communication can identify the root cause. 4. Security Node.js relies heavily on third party modules which can contain vulnerabilities. Scanning for issues and using a private module repository can help. Node.js provides hooks for monitoring and debugging to help diagnose issues. The community is also actively improving tracing and debugging capabilities. With proper monitoring and diagnostics, operations teams can smoothly transition to using Node.js.'}  \n",

Nubank, a major fintech company in Brazil, may have to close down if the Central Bank confirms a new rule on Tuesday, December 20 that would reduce the payment deadline from credit card companies to merchants from 30 days to just 2 days. This change would negatively impact all credit card companies, but especially smaller ones like Nubank that don't have the capital reserves of large banks. Nubank cofounder Cristina Junqueira criticized the idea, saying the current 30 day period allows time for the customer to pay their credit card bill, the issuer to receive the funds, and the purchaser to pay the retailer. She says reducing to 2 days would force Nubank to pay purchasers before even receiving customer payments. Simulations show that even 15 days would require Nubank to raise almost $1 billion in capital immediately to survive. Junqueira describes the potential change as \\\"apocalyptic\\\" and says with just 2 days, Nubank would have to \\\"turn off the light and close the door.\\\".'}  \n",

Wes McKinney and Hadley Wickham met in January to discuss improving interoperability between Python, R, and external systems. They noticed Python pandas dataframes and R dataframes have similar semantic models but different internal memory representations. Around this time Apache Arrow was started to improve data interoperability for columnar tabular data. They decided to use insights from feather to make a fast file format called Feather for storing dataframes usable by both Python and R. Feather is a fast, lightweight binary file format for storing dataframes with goals of simplicity, language agnosticism, and high read/write performance. The Feather API makes reading/writing dataframes easy. Feather is extremely fast, achieving over 600 MB/s write performance on SSDs. Feather can be installed from GitHub for R and PyPI for Python. It is not designed for longterm storage but for exchanging data between Python and R. Feather brings benefits of the Arrow spec to users through efficient languageagnostic tabular data representation. It uses Flatbuffers to serialize column metadata in a languageindependent way. The Python interface uses Cython and the R interface uses Rcpp to expose the C++11 core.'}  "
