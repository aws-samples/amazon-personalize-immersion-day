This replaces the deprecated Email Settings API. Google has extended the Gmail API with new endpoints for managing email settings like filters, forwarding addresses, IMAP/POP settings, sendas aliases, signatures, and vacation responders. Developers can now retrieve and update signatures for sendas aliases, configure forwarding to external addresses, configure sendas aliases through external providers, use HTML in vacation messages, and manipulate settings for gmail.com accounts. More settings features like mailbox delegate support will be added over time. Most settings endpoints work for any Google Apps or Gmail account, but sensitive operations like modifying aliases or forwarding are restricted to service accounts with domainwide authority. The existing Email Settings API in the Admin SDK is deprecated and will be turned down on July 7, 2017 in favor of the updated Gmail API. Google has provided a migration guide to help clients transition.'}\n",

Google announced that Google+ Hangouts On Air will no longer be available starting September 12. Users will be asked to use YouTube Live for livestreaming instead. Google first launched Hangouts On Air in 2011 for select users and opened it up to everyone in 2012. In 2013, Google launched YouTube Live and has now decided to consolidate the two products. After September 12, users won't be able to schedule new Hangouts On Air events. Existing events after this date will need to be moved to YouTube Live. Hangouts On Air will still exist in some form, just not tied to Google+. Users will need to use YouTube Live's builtin scheduling feature instead. To use Hangouts On Air with YouTube Live: Go to Live Streaming Events in Creator Studio, click New live event, select Quick (using Google Hangouts On Air), title the event, schedule it or go live now, and broadcast with Hangouts. Recorded events will still be on YouTube. The only Google+ link will be to see event content in readonly Activity Log. Google began dropping the Google+ requirement across products in 2015, a process still ongoing. Last week Google Play dropped the requirement for reviews. Next month, Hangouts On Air scheduling will move off Google+.'}\n",

This allows you to share files that are only accessible for a limited time. While Google Drive allows setting expiration dates, this is only available for paid Google Workspace accounts. The article provides instructions for free Google account users to create temporary links that autoexpire after a chosen time period. The steps are: 1. Go to labnol.org/expire and authorize the web app to access your Google Drive. 2. Open the File Picker and select the file or folder to share. 3. Enter the email addresses of users to share with. Specify if they get viewer or editor access. 4. Set the time period after which access will be revoked. 5. Click \\\"Set Expiration\\\" and the access will be automatically removed after the set date/time. The article also mentions the Google Drive Auditor addon to analyze permissions on shared files. And the autoexpiry app lists files set to expire.'}\n",

The guides cover topics such as implementing least privilege, managing service accounts, auditing, and policy management. IAM policies can be set at the organization, project, and resource levels. Resources inherit policies from higher levels. The \\\"Designing Resource Hierarchies\\\" guide provides examples for setting policies at different levels. Service accounts are special accounts that belong to an application or VM rather than an individual user.

The unique time synchronization could benefit global businesses. About a decade ago, Google engineers built a global database called Spanner that works across multiple data centers around the world. Spanner behaves as if it's in one place, allowing Google to replicate data and make changes globally without conflicts. This provides consistency across Google services like Gmail and AdWords. Spanner achieves this by using GPS receivers, atomic clocks, and time synchronization technology called TrueTime to establish a common time reference across data centers. This allows for coordination between distributed systems faster than the speed of light. TrueTime is unique to Google. Spanner gives Google a competitive advantage in cloud computing against rivals like Amazon and Microsoft. Google hopes Spanner's global replication and consistency will appeal to global businesses and financial institutions. A supply chain company called JDA is already testing Spanner. Spanner was previously only useful to Google, but now Google is offering it as a cloud service so other companies can benefit from its global scale and unique time synchronization abilities. This could allow businesses to more easily expand globally and replicate data across regions.'}"

But you need a monetization strategy like affiliate links. The article discusses how adding \\\"2016\\\" or \\\"2017\\\" to Google search queries can send huge amounts of traffic to websites. The author first got the idea when searching for \\\"best business books 2016\\\" and realized many people search with the current year to get the most recent results. He tested this on his own site by publishing an article with \\\"2016\\\" in the headline and got tens of thousands of visitors. Another example is the site 10beasts.com which was launched in 2016 with articles about the \\\"best\\\" products that year. Just 4 months after launch the site was getting 100k+ visitors per month and earning $4,687 in commissions. The site BestProducts.com also dominated Google in 2016 for year based terms, getting millions of visitors. To find profitable keywords, the author suggests using Google Trends, Google Keyword Planner, and reverse engineering sites like Amazon. Overall the tactic can drive huge organic search traffic if you target the right keywords, though you need a monetization strategy like affiliate marketing to profit. The key is finding \\\"long tail\\\" keywords with buyer intent that are less competitive. With some effort, the strategy provides a big SEO opportunity in 2017.</td>\n",

It aims to make graph technology more accessible. IBM has launched a new cloud based graph database service called IBM Graph, built on open source Titan and Apache TinkerPop technologies. The service is designed to make graph databases more accessible to developers by providing an interactive tutorial playground to help them learn Gremlin query language. The goal is to get developers up and running with graph technology quickly. IBM Graph provides up to 500MB of free storage and 25,000 free API calls per month. Additional storage and API calls are charged per GB and per 1000 calls. The service runs on IBM data centers on Cassandra for storage, Elasticsearch for indexing, and the open source Titan and TinkerPop technologies. IBM chose not to modify or fork these open source projects in order to maintain compatibility. IBM Graph is focused on transactional workloads by providing a secondary operational data store for real time graph queries from other production applications. Analytic workloads are possible but not the main focus currently. Future plans include making it easier to load and model data for graphs, as modeling decisions are required upfront before loading data. IBM also aims to evolve the offering for analytic workloads like Apache Spark in the future.</td>\n",

This replaces the deprecated Email Settings API. Google has extended the Gmail API with new endpoints for managing email settings like filters, forwarding addresses, IMAP/POP settings, send as aliases, signatures, and vacation responders. Developers can now retrieve and update signatures for send as aliases, configure forwarding to external addresses, configure send as aliases through external providers, use HTML in vacation messages, and manipulate settings for gmail.com accounts. More settings features like mailbox delegate support will be added over time. Most settings endpoints work for any Google Apps or Gmail account, but sensitive operations like modifying aliases or forwarding are restricted to service accounts with domain wide authority. The existing Email Settings API in the Admin SDK is deprecated and will be turned down on July 7, 2017 in favor of the updated Gmail API.

       "      <td>Report finds banks lag in customer experience maturity and investment A global survey on customer experience in banking reveals most institutions lack a formal CX plan and focus more on internal metrics than customer ease. But CX investment is increasing. The report \\\"Improving Customer Experience in Banking\\\" shares results from a global survey on CX maturity in financial institutions. It finds most banks and credit unions are unprepared to meet rising consumer expectations. Digital transformation has enabled personalized, seamless engagement across channels. This increases potential for positive CX but also complexity. Unfortunately CX is not a top priority for many institutions, leading to transactional relationships. To improve CX and meet evolving needs, key priorities emerged: Shift digital focus from cost reduction to experience enhancement. Leverage analytics, machine learning, contextual engagement for personalization. Let customers engage how and when they want. Make advisory and sales proactive vs reactive. Engage throughout the customer journey. The report surveyed banks and credit unions on their CX maturity and provides a benchmark. It was sponsored by Deluxe Corp. Key findings: While all see CX as significant, it's less important at smaller institutions. Only 37% have a formal CX plan. CX objectives focus on internal benefits like sales and costs rather than customer simplicity and ease. Despite digital driving satisfaction, focus remains on products and branches over technology. Most will increase CX investment, especially over next 3 years. CX initiatives so far have had modest impact. Data analytics, legacy technology, customer view are top challenges. CX measurement lacks revenue impact metrics. The report concludes that as \\\"Age of the Individual\\\" emerges, using data and analytics to deliver personalized experiences will separate winners from losers. Banks should start by fixing one issue impeding customer satisfaction through a data driven approach. The complete 85 page report with survey data crosstabs is available for purchase.</td>\n",

To find profitable keywords, the author suggests using Google Trends, Google Keyword Planner, and reverse engineering sites like Amazon. Overall the tactic can drive huge organic search traffic if you target the right keywords, though you need a monetization strategy like affiliate marketing to profit. The key is finding \\\"long tail\\\" keywords with buyer intent that are less competitive. With some effort, the strategy provides a big SEO opportunity in 2017.\n",

It aims to make graph technology more accessible. IBM has launched a new cloud based graph database service called IBM Graph, built on open source Titan and Apache TinkerPop technologies. The service is designed to make graph databases more accessible to developers by providing an interactive tutorial playground to help them learn Gremlin query language. The goal is to get developers up and running with graph technology quickly. IBM Graph provides up to 500MB of free storage and 25,000 free API calls per month. Additional storage and API calls are charged per GB and per 1000 calls. The service runs on IBM data centers on Cassandra for storage, Elasticsearch for indexing, and the open source Titan and TinkerPop technologies. IBM chose not to modify or fork these open source projects in order to maintain compatibility. IBM Graph is focused on transactional workloads by providing a secondary operational data store for real time graph queries from other production applications. Analytic workloads are possible but not the main focus currently. Future plans include making it easier to load and model data for graphs, as modeling decisions are required upfront before loading data. IBM also aims to evolve the offering for analytic workloads like Apache Spark in the future.\n",

This replaces the deprecated Email Settings API. Google has extended the Gmail API with new endpoints for managing email settings like filters, forwarding addresses, IMAP/POP settings, send as aliases, signatures, and vacation responders. Developers can now retrieve and update signatures for send as aliases, configure forwarding to external addresses, configure send as aliases through external providers, use HTML in vacation messages, and manipulate settings for gmail.com accounts. More settings features like mailbox delegate support will be added over time. Most settings endpoints work for any Google Apps or Gmail account, but sensitive operations like modifying aliases or forwarding are restricted to service accounts with domain wide authority. The existing Email Settings API in the Admin SDK is deprecated and will be turned down on July 7, 2017 in favor of the updated Gmail API. Google has provided a migration guide to help clients transition.\n",
       "3084  -8900113512825364282  Report finds banks lag in customer experience maturity and investment A global survey on customer experience in banking reveals most institutions lack a formal CX plan and focus more on internal metrics than customer ease. But CX investment is increasing. The report \\\"Improving Customer Experience in Banking\\\" shares results from a global survey on CX maturity in financial institutions. It finds most banks and credit unions are unprepared to meet rising consumer expectations. Digital transformation has enabled personalized, seamless engagement across channels. This increases potential for positive CX but also complexity. Unfortunately CX is not a top priority for many institutions, leading to transactional relationships. To improve CX and meet evolving needs, key priorities emerged: Shift digital focus from cost reduction to experience enhancement. Leverage analytics, machine learning, contextual engagement for personalization. Let customers engage how and when they want. Make advisory and sales proactive vs reactive. Engage throughout the customer journey. The report surveyed banks and credit unions on their CX maturity and provides a benchmark. It was sponsored by Deluxe Corp. Key findings: While all see CX as significant, it's less important at smaller institutions. Only 37% have a formal CX plan. CX objectives focus on internal benefits like sales and costs rather than customer simplicity and ease. Despite digital driving satisfaction, focus remains on products and branches over technology. Most will increase CX investment, especially over next 3 years. CX initiatives so far have had modest impact. Data analytics, legacy technology, customer view are top challenges. CX measurement lacks revenue impact metrics. The report concludes that as \\\"Age of the Individual\\\" emerges, using data and analytics to deliver personalized experiences will separate winners from losers. Banks should start by fixing one issue impeding customer satisfaction through a data driven approach. The complete 85 page report with survey data crosstabs is available for purchase."

The main migration took around 10 days. The cloud removed Evernote's need to maintain its own data centers and keep up with infrastructure advances. It provides reduced latency for international users through Google's network. Evernote is still migrating some final user attachments but all data is now encrypted at rest. The company has more freedom to leverage cloud services for new features.'}\n",

Google announced that Google+ Hangouts On Air will no longer be available starting September 12. Users will be asked to use YouTube Live for livestreaming instead. Google first launched Hangouts On Air in 2011 for select users and opened it up to everyone in 2012. In 2013, Google launched YouTube Live and has now decided to consolidate the two products. After September 12, users won't be able to schedule new Hangouts On Air events. Existing events after this date will need to be moved to YouTube Live. Hangouts On Air will still exist in some form, just not tied to Google+. Users will need to use YouTube Live's builtin scheduling feature instead. To use Hangouts On Air with YouTube Live: Go to Live Streaming Events in Creator Studio, click New live event, select Quick (using Google Hangouts On Air), title the event, schedule it or go live now, and broadcast with Hangouts. Recorded events will still be on YouTube. The only Google+ link will be to see event content in readonly Activity Log. Google began dropping the Google+ requirement across products in 2015, a process still ongoing. Last week Google Play dropped the requirement for reviews. Next month, Hangouts On Air scheduling will move off Google+.'}\n",

The article provides instructions for free Google account users to create temporary links that autoexpire after a chosen time period. The steps are: 1. Go to labnol.org/expire and authorize the web app to access your Google Drive. 2. Open the File Picker and select the file or folder to share. 3. Enter the email addresses of users to share with. Specify if they get viewer or editor access. 4. Set the time period after which access will be revoked. 5. Click \\\"Set Expiration\\\" and the access will be automatically removed after the set date/time. The article also mentions the Google Drive Auditor addon to analyze permissions on shared files. And the autoexpiry app lists files set to expire.'}"

This article discusses best practices for designing APIs in Java 8. Some key points: Avoid returning null to indicate no value. Use Optional instead. Don't use arrays to pass values in/out of APIs. Use Streams or collections. Avoid allowing direct instantiation of implementation classes. Use static factory methods instead. Favor composition over inheritance. Use lambdas/functional interfaces rather than abstract classes. Use FunctionalInterface annotation on functional interfaces. Avoid overloading methods that take functional interfaces. Validate input parameters before use. Don't call Optional.get() without checking Optional.isPresent(). Split stream pipelines over multiple lines for readability. In general, optimize for simplicity, consistency and hiding implementation details from API users.</td>\n",

This article discusses best practices for designing APIs in Java 8. Some key points: Avoid returning null to indicate no value. Use Optional instead. Don't use arrays to pass values in/out of APIs. Use Streams or collections. Avoid allowing direct instantiation of implementation classes. Use static factory methods instead. Favor composition over inheritance. Use lambdas/functional interfaces rather than abstract classes. Use FunctionalInterface annotation on functional interfaces. Avoid overloading methods that take functional interfaces. Validate input parameters before use. Don't call Optional.get() without checking Optional.isPresent(). Split stream pipelines over multiple lines for readability. In general, optimize for simplicity, consistency and hiding implementation details from API users.\n",

The Ten Commandments of Egoless Programming were originally outlined in Jerry Weinberg's 1971 book The Psychology of Computer Programming. They encourage programmers to seek input, offer constructive criticism, and share knowledge. The principles highlight the importance of collaboration, continuous learning, and focusing on improving code rather than attacking people. Though written decades ago, these ideals remain highly relevant today. Adopting an egoless mindset can foster effective teamwork and lead to better software development outcomes."

It argues that knowing specific APIs is not what makes someone senior. Rather, senior engineers exhibit strong soft skills like reliability, accountability, flexibility, and pragmatism. They are team players who lead by example, listen to others, mentor junior engineers, and constantly look for ways to improve processes. The article emphasizes that senior engineers focus on delivering business value, not just writing clean code. They have the courage to speak up when they see unhealthy team dynamics. The key traits highlighted include: Being reliable and accountable Embracing change and new technologies Focusing on solving business problems Leading by example and mentoring others Listening to and learning from teammates Avoiding arrogance and leveraging authority Speaking up to improve team culture Driving process improvements The article concludes that technical skills naturally improve with experience, but soft skills require dedicated effort.

It aims to help applications scale without sacrificing data consistency. Google has announced Cloud Spanner, a new globally distributed relational database service. Cloud Spanner combines the benefits of traditional relational databases like ACID transactions and SQL with the scalability of NoSQL databases. This allows developers to build applications that can scale horizontally without sacrificing data consistency. Cloud Spanner is a fully managed service that provides automatic scaling, high availability, and disaster recovery. It has a simple pricing model based on compute usage, storage, and network egress. Cloud Spanner supports standard relational database tools and languages like JDBC drivers and SQL queries. It is ideal for operational workloads like inventory management and financial transactions that are outgrowing traditional databases. Google has been developing the Spanner technology internally since 2007. It powers critical Google services like AdWords and Google Play, handling millions of queries per second. The research behind Spanner was published in 2012. Early adopters like Quizlet and JDA see Cloud Spanner as a compelling solution to scale their relational workloads beyond what sharding can achieve.

Olof Schybergson and Shelley Evenson argue that design thinking alone is not enough for organizations to innovate successfully. They propose the \\\"Design Rule of 3\\\": combining design thinking, design doing, and design culture. Design thinking involves empathy, cocreation, and prototyping. But it must be paired with design doing the actual creation process led by experts. This requires diverse teams and flexible workspaces. Finally, design culture is crucial. This means recruiting change agents, enabling continuous learning, and creating open work environments. With commitment over years, not months, design can become an organization's sustainable differentiator. Google is an example that improved through this approach. The company established a common design language and gave designers more influence. This helped unify Google's offerings into a coherent family of products. Commerzbank is trying to instill design from within instead of acquiring a consultancy. The shift in mindset and culture will take time. An effective design system based on the Design Rule of 3 can boost performance and value. By putting people first, design creates enduring customer relationships and a happier workforce.'}</td>\n",

They are team players who lead by example, listen to others, mentor junior engineers, and constantly look for ways to improve processes. The article emphasizes that senior engineers focus on delivering business value, not just writing clean code. They have the courage to speak up when they see unhealthy team dynamics. The key traits highlighted include: Being reliable and accountable Embracing change and new technologies Focusing on solving business problems Leading by example and mentoring others Listening to and learning from teammates Avoiding arrogance and leveraging authority Speaking up to improve team culture Driving process improvements The article concludes that technical skills naturally improve with experience, but soft skills require dedicated effort.

Olof Schybergson and Shelley Evenson argue that design thinking alone is not enough for organizations to innovate successfully. They propose the \\\"Design Rule of 3\\\": combining design thinking, design doing, and design culture. Design thinking involves empathy, cocreation, and prototyping. But it must be paired with design doing the actual creation process led by experts. This requires diverse teams and flexible workspaces. Finally, design culture is crucial. This means recruiting change agents, enabling continuous learning, and creating open work environments. With commitment over years, not months, design can become an organization's sustainable differentiator. Google is an example that improved through this approach. The company established a common design language and gave designers more influence. This helped unify Google's offerings into a coherent family of products. Commerzbank is trying to instill design from within instead of acquiring a consultancy. The shift in mindset and culture will take time. An effective design system based on the Design Rule of 3 can boost performance and value. By putting people first, design creates enduring customer relationships and a happier workforce.'}"

The benefits of Node.js include enabling faster development and deployment. However, its speed introduces challenges for operations and performance teams who focus on availability and performance. Some common Node.js problems these teams face include: 1. Memory leaks Node.js is prone to memory leaks which cause crashes. Heap dumps can help track down the cause. 2. CPU problems Node.js runs singlethreaded so CPUheavy operations can block requests. CPU sampling can identify where time is being spent. 3. Back pressure Slow backends can cause congestion in Node.js. Monitoring intertier communication can identify the root cause. 4. Security Node.js relies heavily on third party modules which can contain vulnerabilities. Scanning for issues and using a private module repository can help. Node.js provides hooks for monitoring and debugging to help diagnose issues. The community is also actively improving tracing and debugging capabilities.

The book Peopleware found that the top performing developers worked in spaces that were quieter and more private compared to lower performers. IBM and Gerald McCue also found that developers need at least 100 square feet of personal space and noise protection like offices to work optimally. When considering job offers, developers often choose companies that provide private offices because it shows they value developers' needs. Even if companies can't provide private offices, they can still attract developers by calculating the benefits like increased productivity and lower turnover versus the costs.

Node.js is a fast growing platform used by many startups and enterprises. It acts as a new tier that connects legacy systems with new technologies. The benefits of Node.js include enabling faster development and deployment. However, its speed introduces challenges for operations and performance teams who focus on availability and performance. Some common Node.js problems these teams face include: 1. Memory leaks Node.js is prone to memory leaks which cause crashes. Heap dumps can help track down the cause. 2. CPU problems Node.js runs singlethreaded so CPUheavy operations can block requests. CPU sampling can identify where time is being spent. 3. Back pressure Slow backends can cause congestion in Node.js. Monitoring intertier communication can identify the root cause. 4. Security Node.js relies heavily on third party modules which can contain vulnerabilities. Scanning for issues and using a private module repository can help.

The author calls this \\\"Hype Driven Development\\\" (HDD) and sees it as harmful, advocating instead for \\\"Solid Software Engineering\\\". HDD has many forms: adopting a technology because of social media buzz, conferences, vocal team members, or copypasting Stack Overflow solutions without understanding. This results in bad decisions that hurt projects months or years later, sometimes requiring big rewrites. The hype cycle: A company solves a real problem with a new framework, talks about it, blurring complex details. Teams adopt it expecting benefits but get slowed down instead. Finally they realize the tradeoffs. Examples: React.js good for complex UIs but overused. \\\"TDD is dead\\\" skipped tests create bugs. Microservices premature modularization hurts development. NoSQL poor fit and harder queries. Elixir/Phoenix learning curve slows teams. The author argues hype leads to hasty, poorly informed choices.

Nubank, a major fintech company in Brazil, may have to close down if the Central Bank confirms a new rule on Tuesday, December 20 that would reduce the payment deadline from credit card companies to merchants from 30 days to just 2 days. This change would negatively impact all credit card companies, but especially smaller ones like Nubank that don't have the capital reserves of large banks. Nubank cofounder Cristina Junqueira criticized the idea, saying the current 30 day period allows time for the customer to pay their credit card bill, the issuer to receive the funds, and the purchaser to pay the retailer. She says reducing to 2 days would force Nubank to pay purchasers before even receiving customer payments. Simulations show that even 15 days would require Nubank to raise almost $1 billion in capital immediately to survive.

DCI is researching how blockchain could reshape the internet and reduce 'echo chambers' where people only see news from limited sources. They are exploring IPFS and Blockstack which aim to decentralize control of information. However, Narula believes underlying economic incentives of megaplatforms like Facebook and Google are the core issue. Another focus is improving privacy and confidentiality in blockchains while retaining auditability. The 'Auditable Ledger' project explores this for banking ledgers, allowing auditors to verify systemlevel details while preserving user privacy. DCI is also building a prototype central bank cryptocurrency with former Bank of England researcher Robleh Ali. This explores how privacy and auditability could be balanced in a central bank context.

Software development teams often adopt new technologies based on hype and trends rather than research, leading to poor architectural decisions. The author calls this \\\"Hype Driven Development\\\" (HDD) and sees it as harmful, advocating instead for \\\"Solid Software Engineering\\\". HDD has many forms: adopting a technology because of social media buzz, conferences, vocal team members, or copypasting Stack Overflow solutions without understanding. This results in bad decisions that hurt projects months or years later, sometimes requiring big rewrites. The hype cycle: A company solves a real problem with a new framework, talks about it, blurring complex details. Teams adopt it expecting benefits but get slowed down instead. Finally they realize the tradeoffs. Examples: React.js good for complex UIs but overused. \\\"TDD is dead\\\" skipped tests create bugs. Microservices premature modularization hurts development. NoSQL poor fit and harder queries. Elixir/Phoenix learning curve slows teams. The author argues hype leads to hasty, poorly informed choices. New ideas spread quickly via social media, faster than their pros and cons are understood. Teams should carefully evaluate new technologies for their specific needs rather than assume they are a silver bullet.'}\n",

Nubank, a major fintech company in Brazil, may have to close down if the Central Bank confirms a new rule on Tuesday, December 20 that would reduce the payment deadline from credit card companies to merchants from 30 days to just 2 days. This change would negatively impact all credit card companies, but especially smaller ones like Nubank that don't have the capital reserves of large banks. Nubank cofounder Cristina Junqueira criticized the idea, saying the current 30 day period allows time for the customer to pay their credit card bill, the issuer to receive the funds, and the purchaser to pay the retailer. She says reducing to 2 days would force Nubank to pay purchasers before even receiving customer payments. Simulations show that even 15 days would require Nubank to raise almost $1 billion in capital immediately to survive. Junqueira describes the potential change as \\\"apocalyptic\\\" and says with just 2 days, Nubank would have to \\\"turn off the light and close the door.\\\".'}\n",

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) launched its Digital Currency Initiative (DCI) in 2015 to research blockchain technology. The initiative is led by former White House advisor Neha Narula and has 22 team members working on over 7 projects. DCI is researching how blockchain could reshape the internet and reduce 'echo chambers' where people only see news from limited sources. They are exploring IPFS and Blockstack which aim to decentralize control of information. However, Narula believes underlying economic incentives of megaplatforms like Facebook and Google are the core issue. Another focus is improving privacy and confidentiality in blockchains while retaining auditability. The 'Auditable Ledger' project explores this for banking ledgers, allowing auditors to verify systemlevel details while preserving user privacy. DCI is also building a prototype central bank cryptocurrency with former Bank of England researcher Robleh Ali. This explores how privacy and auditability could be balanced in a central bank context. Overall DCI is researching a wide range of blockchain applications from reshaping the internet to central bank currencies, while tackling technical challenges like privacy and auditability.'}\n",

It was created by Vitalik Buterin and publicly released in 2015. Ethereum aims to improve on some of Bitcoin's limitations by offering more flexibility and allowing developers to create any kind of application on top of its blockchain. One key feature of Ethereum is its smart contract functionality, which allows agreements to be automatically executed when certain conditions are met. This enables complex applications to be built on top of Ethereum. The system is decentralized and run on a network of computers called nodes. Ethereum has generated significant interest from major banks and companies looking to utilize blockchain technology. However, it could face regulatory and technical challenges similar to those encountered by Bitcoin. While Bitcoin's creator remains anonymous, Ethereum was created in a more transparent manner by Buterin. Ethereum also has a dedicated team of developers building applications on the platform.'}\n",
