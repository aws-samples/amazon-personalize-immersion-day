The Converse API makes it easy to incorporate tool use into your AI applications by enabling models to generate more useful and relevant responses, providing a consistent API for using tools across models, and allowing for more advanced conversational applications with external data and capabilities.\n",

We'll define the necessary tools: Amazon Personalize resources together with synthetic responses to showcase the agent's capabilities."

    "## Tool definition\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create a mix of tools that use synthetic data and tools that will call Amazon Personalize resources created in [01_Recommender-Agent_Configure-Personalize-Resources.ipynb](./01_Recommender-Agent_Configure-Personalize-Resources.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions correspond to the tools we defined earlier for our personalized recommender agent. They represent the actual implementation of the capabilities that the agent will have access to when assisting customers. It's crucial to understand that these functions are the resources the agent can execute, but the Large Language Model (LLM) itself does not directly execute these functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how the process works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The LLM (in this case, Claude) analyzes the user's request and formulates a plan using the available tools.\n",
    "2. When the LLM determines that a tool should be used, it doesn't execute the function itself. Instead, it indicates which tool should be used and with what parameters.\n",
    "3. The agent framework (which is separate from the LLM) then executes the corresponding function and returns the result.\n",
    "4. The LLM receives the result of the tool execution and uses this information to continue its plan or formulate a response to the user.\n",
    "5. This process of planning, tool use, and result interpretation continues until the LLM can generate a final answer without needing additional tool use.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the provided code, we see a mix of tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some use synthetic data (like get_customer_id and get_order_details), which is useful for testing and development.\n",
    "- Others interact with real services, such as Amazon Personalize (like **get_recommended_products, get_similar_items** and **purchase_order**), which were set up in a previous notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "This combination allows for a realistic simulation of a production environment while still providing controlled data for certain operations.\n",
    "Remember, the LLM's role is to understand the user's request, plan the necessary steps using these tools, and interpret the results to provide a coherent response to the user. The actual execution of these functions is handled by the agent framework, creating a powerful and flexible system for personalized customer assistance."

    "## Process tool calls and return results\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll create a function to process the tool calls made by Claude and return the appropriate results. The `process_tool_call` function is crucial for bridging the gap between the language model's decisions and the actual execution of tools in our system. Here's why it's important and how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a tool call?\n",
    "A tool call is a request made by the language model (Claude 3) to use a specific tool with certain input parameters. It's the model's way of indicating that it needs to use a particular function to gather information or perform an action in response to a user's query.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why do we need to process tool calls?\n",
    "We need to process tool calls for several reasons:\n",
    "1. The language model doesn't directly execute code or access data sources.\n",
    "2. We need to translate the model's high-level requests into actual function calls in our system.\n",
    "3. It allows us to control and monitor what actions are being taken on behalf of the model.\n",
    "4. We can add error handling, logging, or additional logic as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the model selects tools\n",
    "The model selects tools based on its understanding of:\n",
    "- The user's query\n",
    "- The available tools and their descriptions\n",
    "- The current context of the conversation\n",
    "- What information it needs to answer the query or perform the requested task\n",
    "\n",
    "The model uses its reasoning to determine which tool is most appropriate for gathering the necessary information or performing the required action.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The process_tool_call function\n",
    "This function acts as a bridge between the model's high-level tool requests and the actual function calls in our system. It:\n",
    "- Takes the tool name and input parameters as arguments\n",
    "- Maps these to the corresponding Python functions we defined earlier\n",
    "- Calls the appropriate function with the given inputs\n",
    "- Returns the result back to the model\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup allows the language model to make decisions about what information or actions are needed, while keeping the actual execution of these actions under the control of our system. It's a way of giving the model access to external data and capabilities without giving it direct control over the system's resources."

    "\n",
    "### Agent's Logic Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: \n",
    "   - Set up the initial context and system prompt for the agent.\n",
    "   - This prompt will guide the agent's behavior and set the context for our e-commerce recommender system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **User Input**: \n",
    "   - Receive the user's message or query.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **LLM Processing**:\n",
    "   - Send the user's input, along with the current context and system prompt, to Claude.\n",
    "   - Claude analyzes the input and determines the next action (either responding directly or using a tool or a set of tools).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Tool Execution (if needed)**:\n",
    "   - If Claude decides to use a tool, our function will:\n",
    "     a. Extract the tool name and parameters from Claude's response.\n",
    "     b. Call the `process_tool_call` function to execute the appropriate tool.\n",
    "     c. Capture the tool's output.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Result Interpretation**:\n",
    "   - Send the tool's output back to Claude for interpretation.\n",
    "   - Claude may decide to use another tool or formulate a final response.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Response Generation**:\n",
    "   - Once Claude has gathered all necessary information, it generates a final response to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Conversation Update**:\n",
    "   - Update the conversation history with the user's input and the agent's response.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Repeat**:\n",
    "   - The process repeats for each user input, maintaining context throughout the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### System Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "The system prompt is crucial as it sets the tone, capabilities, and limitations of our agent. Our system prompt includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The agent's role as an AI assistant for product purchases and order management\n",
    "- A step-by-step guide for the agent to follow when assisting customers\n",
    "- Rules for interaction and information gathering\n",
    "- Guidelines for tool usage and response formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "By encapsulating this logic in a single function, we create a modular and maintainable structure for our chatbot. This allows for easy updates to the agent's behavior and capabilities as needed."
