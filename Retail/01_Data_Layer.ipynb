    "# Welcome to the Retail Demo Store <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"top\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You have just been hired by the Retail Demo Store, which is a new online retail store that launched and is jumping into the crowded space of online sales. You have been hired into the Search & Discovery team, which leads efforts around personalization. Currently, most of your app does not provide a personalized experience, the products are presented in a static order for all users. In order to prevent customer churn, you are looking to add personalized experiences. \n",
    "\n",
    "You’ve been asked by the founders to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Increase subscriber engagement by tailoring every experience to individual users\n",
    "- Help users discover newly released products\n",
    "- Increase the breadth of content offered to them from the Retail Demo Store catalog\n",
    "- Reduce the time to value by creating valuable recommendations in a short time\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the course of this workshop you will be exploring your datasets, building/training several recommendation models and implementing recommendations with API's.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> importing and training the datasets will take longer than we have in this workshop. In order to complete this workshop within the time set, we have already created several resources on your behalf.  However, the notebooks are designed in such a way that all the steps are included. If the resources have already been created, the cell will return information about the resources, if the resources have not been created, it will create them for you. \n",

    "### Executing cells\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is broken up into cells like the one below. There's a triangular **Run** button at the top of this page that you can click to execute each cell and move onto the next, or you can press `Shift` + `Enter` while in the cell to execute it and move onto the next one.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a cell is executing, you'll notice an `*` in the checkbox beside the cell. When the cell has finished running, the checkbox will contain a number to indicate the order the cell was executed in with respect to all the other cells in the notebook.\n",

    "Simply follow the instructions below and execute the cells to get started with Amazon Personalize.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the code\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook can be used in two modalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Train as you go by executing each cell. Some cells may take a long time to finish executing as they wait for resources to be created.\n",
    "2. Use this notebook with previously created resources. All or the majority of the resources will already be created, and cells will just retrieve the information of these existing resources to use them in following steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this, you will find that some cells have `try` and `except` blocks. In particular, most of them are handling a `ResourceAlreadyExistsException` exception. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can look at the code in the `try` block to get a good idea of how you can create a resource and understand how to use the Amazon Personalize SDK. The `except` block will let you know that the resource has been created and record the corresponding ARN, which is the Amazon unique identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of the `try` block for creating a dataset group, this code will execute without exceptions if the dataset group does not exist and raise an exception if the dataset group does already exist:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:     \n",
    "    # Try to create the dataset group, this block with exectute fully if the dataset group does not exist yet\n",
    "    \n",
    "    create_dataset_group_response = personalize.create_dataset_group(\n",
    "        name = workshop_dataset_group_name,\n",
    "        domain='ECOMMERCE'\n",
    "    )\n",
    "    workshop_dataset_group_arn = create_dataset_group_response['datasetGroupArn']\n",
    "    print(json.dumps(create_dataset_group_response, indent=2))\n",
    "    print ('\\nCreating the Dataset Group with dataset_group_arn = {}'.format(workshop_dataset_group_arn))\n",
    "```\n",
    "and this is the corresponding `except` block that will be executed if an exception is raised because the dataset group already exists. This block saves the ARN for the existing dataset group to use later and lets you know the resource already exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "except personalize.exceptions.ResourceAlreadyExistsException as e:\n",
    "    workshop_dataset_group_arn = 'arn:aws:personalize:'+region+':'+account_id+':dataset group/' + \n",

    "        workshop_dataset_group_arn))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the resource, you may also find that sometimes the code will check from a list of resources to find if a resource exists and then use `if` and `else` blocks to either use the existing resource or create it."

    "Note that `CATEGORY_L1`, `CATEGORY_L2`, and `GENDER` are annotated as being categorical (`\"categorical\": true`). This tells Personalize to interpret the column value for each row as one or more categorical values, where the `|` character can be used to separate values. For example, `value1|value2|value3`. The `PRODUCT_DESCRIPTION` column is annotated as being a text column (`\"textual\": true`). This tells Personalize that this column contains unstructured text. A natural language processing (NLP) model is used to extract features from the textual column to use as features in the model. Including a textual column in your items dataset can significantly enhance the relevancy of recommendations. Currently, only one textual column can be included in the items dataset and the text must be in English.
