    "To run this notebook, you need to have run [the previous notebook: `01_Data_Layer.ipynb`](01_Data_Layer.ipynb), where you prepared 3 datasets (interactions, items, and users) for use in Amazon Personalize. At the end of that notebook, you saved some variable values, which you now need to load into this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"intro\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook we prepared 3 different datasets that represent our fictional retail store (User interactions, Product catalog data and buyer/user data) and created Datasets in Amazon Personalize for this data.\n",

    "In this notebook we will define our use-case, train models and create APIs to get recommendations.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are a few guidelines for scoping a problem suitable for Personalize. We recommend the values below as a starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "* At least 50 unique users (identified by a user_id)\n",
    "* At least 100 unique items\n",
    "* At least 2 dozen interactions for each user \n",
    "\n",
    "The [minimum data requirements](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/how-it-works-dataset-schema.html) can be found in the documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time this is easily attainable, and if you are low in one category, you can often make up for it by having a larger number in another category.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user-item-iteraction data is key for getting started with the service. This means we need to look for use cases that generate that kind of data, a few common examples are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Video-on-demand applications\n",
    "1. E-commerce platforms\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining your use-case will inform what data and what type of data you need.\n",

    "In this section we will be creating ECOMMERCE Use Case Optimized Recommenders for the following use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Customers who viewed X also viewed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/ECOMMERCE-use-cases.html#customers-also-viewed-use-case): Get recommendations for items that customers also viewed based on an item that you specify. With this use case, Amazon Personalize automatically filters items the user purchased based on the userId that you specify and `Purchase` events.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Recommended For You](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/ECOMMERCE-use-cases.html#recommended-for-you-use-case): Get personalized recommendations for items based on a user that you specify. With this use case, Amazon Personalize automatically filters items the user purchased based on the userId that you specify and Purchase events. For better performance, include `Purchase` events along with the required `View` events.\n",
    "\n",
    "in addition we will create a custom solution, solution version and campaign for the following use case:\n",
    "\n",
    "3. [Personalized Ranking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/personalized-ranking-recipes.html): will be used to rank a list of items.\n",

Given 10 users, with 10 interactions each (a circle represents an interaction), the interactions are ordered from oldest to newest based on the timestamp. Personalize uses all the interaction data from 90% of the users (blue circles) to train the solution version, and the remaining 10% for evaluation. For each of the users in the remaining 10%, 90% of their interaction data (green circles) is used as input for the call to the trained model.

This metric is appropriate if you're interested in the single highest ranked recommendation.\n",

The normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) is the DCG divided by the ideal DCG such that NDCG is between 0 - 1. (The ideal DCG is where the top K recommendations are sorted by relevance.) Amazon Personalize uses a weighting factor of 1/log(1 + position), where the top of the list is position 1.
