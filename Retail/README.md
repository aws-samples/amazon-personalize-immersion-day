## Introduction

Congratulations! You have just been hired by the Retail Demo Store, which is a new online retail store that launched and is jumping into the crowded space of online sales. You have been hired into the Search & Discovery team, which leads efforts around personalization. Currently, most of your app does not provide a personalized experience, the products are presented in a static order for all users. In order to prevent customer churn and increase sales, you are looking to add personalized experiences. 

Youâ€™ve been asked by the founders to:

- Increase subscriber engagement by tailoring every experience to individual users
- Help users discover newly released products
- Increase the breadth of content offered to them from the Retail Demo Store catalog
- Reduce the time to value by creating valuable recommendations in a short time

Throughout the course of this workshop you will be exploring your datasets, building/training several recommendation models and implementing recommendations with API's.
In this workshop, we will add personalized recommendations to the UnicornFlix SVOD website. The workshop is split into the following sections:
