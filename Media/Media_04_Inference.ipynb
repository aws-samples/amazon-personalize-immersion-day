    "Personalize can utilize either [static or dynamic filters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/filter.html). Static filters are where the filter properties are built into the filter itself, which makes invocation simpler, but gives less flexibility. An example of this would be a \"Horror\" movie filter, which invokes the get_recommendations_response api with the specific filter of GENRE = Horror. In order to create a recommendation for each filter that would require 10+ filters. Personalize also supports dynamic filters, where the values can be passed at runtime, allowing for a single filter of GENRE, where the actual genre is passed at runtime. \n",

    "\n",
    "Categorical filters based on Item Metadata - Often your item metadata will have information about the title such as Genre, Keyword, Year, Director, Actor etc. Filtering on these can provide recommendations within that data, such as action movies, Steven Spielberg movies, Movies from 1995 etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Range based filters based on Item Metadata - Personalize supports range operations in both static and dynamic filters. Filtering based on a range can be used to create recommendations such as \"Whats on now\" in live tv scenarios, best of decade, Movies rated over 8/10 stars etc\n",
    "\n",
    "Events - you may want to filter out certain events and provide results based on those events, such as moving a title from a \"suggestions to watch\" recommendation to a \"watch again\" recommendations.\n"
