    "# Welcome to UnicornFlix!\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You have just been hired by UnicornFlix, which is a new Direct to Consumer Streaming service that launched and is jumping into the crowded space of Video on Demand/Free Ad Supported TV (FAST) providers. You have been hired into the Search & Discovery team which leads efforts around personalization. Currently most of your app does not provide a personalized experience, the movies are presented in a static order for all users. In order to prevent customer churn, you are looking to add personalized experiences. \n",
    "\n",
    "You’ve been asked by the founders to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Increase subscriber engagement by tailoring every experience to individual users\n",
    "- Help users discover newly released content\n",
    "- Increase the breadth of content offered to them from the UnicornFlix catalog\n",
    "- Reduce the time to value by creating valuable recommendations in a short time\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the this workshop you will be exploring your datasets, building/training several recommendation models and implementing recommendations with API's.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## In this Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will choose a dataset and prepare it for use with Amazon Personalize.\n",

    "1. [Introduction to Amazon Personalize Datasets](#datasets)\n",

    "## How to Use the Notebook <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"usenotebook\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Executing cells\n",
    "The code is broken up into cells like the one below. There's a triangular Run button at the top of this page that you can click to execute each cell and move onto the next, or you can press `Shift` + `Enter` while in the cell to execute it and move onto the next one.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a cell is executing you'll notice a line to the side showcase an `*` while the cell is running or it will update to a number to indicate the last cell that completed executing after it has finished exectuting all the code within a cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply follow the instructions below and execute the cells to get started with Amazon Personalize.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the code\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook can be used in two modalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Train as you go by executing each cell. Some cells may take a long time to finish executing as they wait for resources to be created. You will have this experience if you deployed the 'simple'  Amazon CloudFormation template ([personalizeIDSimple.yaml](../personalizeIDSimple.yaml)).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Go through notebook with previously created resources. All or the majority of the resources will already be created and cells will just retrieve the information of these existing resources to use them in following steps. You will have this experience if you deployed the 'pretrained' Amazon CloudFormation template ([PersonalizeIDPretrained.yaml](../PersonalizeIDPretrained.yaml)).\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> If you deployed the 'pretrained' template, you must wait at least 3 hours for all resources to tbe trained before proceeding with the workshop.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this, you will find that some cells have `try` and `except` blocks. In particular most of them are handling a `ResourceAlreadyExistsException` exception. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can look at the code in the `try` block to get a good idea of how you can create a resource and understand how to use the Amazon Personalize SDK. The `except` block will let you know that the resource has been created and record the corresponding ARN, which is the Amazon unique identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of the `try` block for creating a dataset group, this code will execute without exceptions if the dataset group does not exist and raise an exception if the dataset group does already exist:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try: \n",
    "    create_dataset_group_response = personalize.create_dataset_group(\n",
    "        name = workshop_dataset_group_name,\n",
    "        domain='VIDEO_ON_DEMAND'\n",
    "    )\n",
    "\n",
    "    workshop_dataset_group_arn = create_dataset_group_response['datasetGroupArn']\n",
    "    print(json.dumps(create_dataset_group_response, indent=2))\n",
    "    print ('\\nCreating the Dataset Group with dataset_group_arn = {}'.format(workshop_dataset_group_arn))\n",
    "    \n",
    "```\n",
    "and this is the corresponding `except` block that will be exectuted if an exeption is raised becuse the dataset group already exists. This block saves the ARN for the existig dataset group to use later and lets you know the resource already exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "except personalize.exceptions.ResourceAlreadyExistsException as e:\n",
    "    workshop_dataset_group_arn = 'arn:aws:personalize:'+region+':'+account_id+':dataset group/' + \n",
    "        workshop_dataset_group_name \n",
    "    print ('\\nThe the Dataset Group with dataset_group_arn = {} already exists'.format(\n",
    "        workshop_dataset_group_arn))\n",
    "    print ('\\nWe will be using the existing Dataset Group dataset_group_arn = {}'.format(\n",
    "        workshop_dataset_group_arn))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the resource, you may also find that sometimes the code will check from a list of resourses to find if a resource exists and then use `if` and `else` blocks to either use the existing resource or create it."

MoviesLens is an explicit movie rating dataset, which means users are presented a movie and asked to give it a rating. For recommendation systems/personalization, the industry has moved on to using more implicit data. This is due to many reasons including low numbers of customers rating titles and customers tastes changing over time. Some of the benefits of implicit interaction data is that it is the actual behavior of all users and changes over time as their viewing behavior changes.\n",

    "- Ratings of 2 and 3 stars are neutral to slightly positive, we are going to create synthetic \"Click\" events to simulate a viewer clicking on a title in the UnicornFlix app\n",
    "- Ratings of 4 and 5 are overwhelmingly positive, we will use these to create synthetic \"Watch\" and \"Click\" events to simulate a viewer both clicking on a title and watching at least 80% of a title in the UnicornFlix app\n",
